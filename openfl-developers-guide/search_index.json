The OpenFL event model is not only convenient, but also standards-compliant, and well integrated with the display list. Based on the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification, an industry-standard event- handling architecture, the new event model provides a powerful yet intuitive event-handling tool for Haxe programmers.\nThe OpenFL event-handling system interacts closely with the display list. To gain a basic understanding of the display list, read Display programming.\nSection Contents\n\nBasics of handling events\nThe event flow\nEvent objects\nEvent listeners\n\n\nMore Help topics\n\nopenfl.events package\nDocument Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification\n\n"},"handling-events/basics-of-handling-events.html":{"url":"handling-events/basics-of-handling-events.html","title":"Basics of handling events","keywords":"","body":"Basics of handling events \nYou can think of events as occurrences of any kind in your project that are of interest to you as a programmer. For example, most projects support user interaction of some sort—whether it’s something as simple as responding to a mouse click or something more complex, such as accepting and processing data entered into a form. Any such user interaction with your project is considered an event. Events can also occur without any direct user interaction, such as when data has finished loading from a server or when an attached camera has become active.\nIn OpenFL, each event is represented by an event object, which is an instance of the Event class or one of its subclasses. An event object not only stores information about a specific event, but also contains methods that facilitate manipulation of the event object. For example, when OpenFL detects a mouse click, it creates an event object (an instance of the MouseEvent class) to represent that particular mouse click event.\nAfter creating an event object, OpenFL dispatches it, which means that the event object is passed to the object that is the target of the event. An object that serves as the destination for a dispatched event object is called an event target. For example, when an attached camera becomes active, OpenFL dispatches an event object directly to the event target, which in this case is the object that represents the camera. If the event target is on the display list, however, the event object is passed down through the display list hierarchy until it reaches the event target. In some cases, the event object then \"bubbles\" back up the display list hierarchy along the same route. This traversal of the display list hierarchy is called the event flow.\nYou can \"listen\" for event objects in your code using event listeners. Event listeners are the functions or methods that you write to respond to specific events. To ensure that your program responds to events, you must add event listeners either to the event target or to any display list object that is part of an event object’s event flow.\nAny time you write event listener code, it follows this basic structure (elements in bold are placeholders you’d fill in for your specific case):\nprivate function eventResponse (eventObject:EventType):Void {\n\n    // Actions performed in response to the event go here.\n\n}\n\neventTarget.addEventListener (EventType.EVENT_NAME, eventResponse);\n\nThis code does two things. First, it defines a function, which is the way to specify the actions that will be performed in response to the event. Next, it calls the addEventListener() method of the source object, in essence \"subscribing\" the function to the specified event so that when the event happens, the function’s actions are carried out. When the event actually happens, the event target checks its list of all the functions and methods that are registered as event listeners. It then calls each one in turn, passing the event object as a parameter.\nYou need to alter four things in this code to create your own event listener. First, you must change the name of the function to the name you want to use (this must be changed in two places, where the code says eventResponse). Second, you must specify the appropriate class name of the event object that is dispatched by the event you want to listen for (EventType in the code), and you must specify the appropriate constant for the specific event (EVENT_NAME in the listing). Third, you must call the addEventListener() method on the object that will dispatch the event (eventTarget in this code). Optionally, you can change the name of the variable used as the function’s parameter (eventObject in this code).\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter when writing event-handling routines:\nBubbling Bubbling occurs for some events so that a parent display object can respond to events dispatched by its children.\nBubbling phase The part of the event flow in which an event propagates up to parent display objects. The bubbling phase occurs after the capture and target phases.\nCapture phase The part of the event flow in which an event propagates down from the most general target to the most specific target object. The capture phase occurs before the target and bubbling phases.\nDefault behavior Some events include a behavior that normally happens along with the event, known as the default behavior. For example, when a user types text in a text field, a text input event is raised. The default behavior for that event is to actually display the character that was typed into the text field—but you can override that default behavior (if for some reason you don’t want the typed character to be displayed).\nDispatch To notify event listeners that an event has occurred.\nEvent Something that happens to an object that the object can tell other objects about.\nEvent flow When events happen to an object on the display list (an object displayed on the screen), all the objects that contain the object are notified of the event and notify their event listeners in turn. This process starts with the Stage and proceeds through the display list to the actual object where the event occurred, and then proceeds back to the Stage again. This process is known as the event flow.\nEvent object An object that contains information about a particular event’s occurrence, which is sent to all listeners when an event is dispatched.\nEvent target The object that actually dispatches an event. For example, if the user clicks a button that is inside a Sprite that is in turn inside the Stage, all those objects dispatch events, but the event target is the one where the event actually happened—in this case, the clicked button.\nListener An object or function that has registered itself with an object, to indicate that it should be notified when a specific event takes place.\nTarget phase The point of the event flow at which an event has reached the most specific possible target. The target phase occurs between the capture and the bubbling phases.\n"},"handling-events/the-event-flow.html":{"url":"handling-events/the-event-flow.html","title":"The event flow","keywords":"","body":"The event flow \nOpenFL dispatches event objects whenever an event occurs. If the event target is not on the display list, OpenFL dispatches the event object directly to the event target. For example, OpenFL dispatches the progress event object directly to a URLStream object. If the event target is on the display list, however, OpenFL dispatches the event object into the display list, and the event object travels through the display list to the event target.\nThe event flow describes how an event object moves through the display list. The display list is organized in a hierarchy that can be described as a tree. At the top of the display list hierarchy is the Stage, which is a special display object container that serves as the root of the display list. The Stage is represented by the openfl.display.Stage class and can only be accessed through a display object. Every display object has a property named stage that refers to the Stage for that application.\nWhen OpenFL dispatches an event object for a display list-related event, that event object makes a round- trip journey from the Stage to the target node. The DOM Events Specification defines the target node as the node representing the event target. In other words, the target node is the display list object where the event occurred. For example, if a user clicks on a display list object named child1, OpenFL will dispatch an event object using child1 as the target node.\nThe event flow is conceptually divided into three parts. The first part is called the capture phase; this phase comprises all of the nodes from the Stage to the parent of the target node. The second part is called the target phase, which consists solely of the target node. The third part is called the bubbling phase. The bubbling phase comprises the nodes encountered on the return trip from the parent of the target node back to the Stage.\nThe names of the phases make more sense if you conceive of the display list as a vertical hierarchy with the Stage at the top, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nIf a user clicks on Child1 Node, OpenFL dispatches an event object into the event flow. As the following image shows, the object’s journey starts at Stage, moves down to Parent Node, then moves to Child1 Node, and then \"bubbles\" back up to Stage, moving through Parent Node again on its journey back to Stage.\n\nIn this example, the capture phase comprises Stage and Parent Node during the initial downward journey. The target phase comprises the time spent at Child1 Node. The bubbling phase comprises Parent Node and Stage as they are encountered during the upward journey back to the root node.\nThe ability to add event listeners along the event flow is useful when a user interface component comprises more than one object. For example, a button object often contains a text object that serves as the button’s label. Without the ability to add a listener to the event flow, you would have to add a listener to both the button object and the text object to ensure that you receive notification about click events that occur anywhere on the button. The existence of the event flow, however, allows you to place a single event listener on the button object that handles click events that occur either on the text object or on the areas of the button object that are not obscured by the text object.\nNot every event object, however, participates in all three phases of the event flow. Some types of events, such as the enterFrame and init event types, are dispatched directly to the target node and participate in neither the capture phase nor the bubbling phase. Other events may target objects that are not on the display list, such as events dispatched to an instance of the Socket class. These event objects will also flow directly to the target object, without participating in the capture and bubbling phases.\nTo find out how a particular event type behaves, you can either check the API documentation or examine the event object’s properties. Examining the event object’s properties is described in the following section.\n"},"handling-events/event-objects.html":{"url":"handling-events/event-objects.html","title":"Event objects","keywords":"","body":"Event objects \nEvent objects serve two main purposes in the new event-handling system. First, event objects represent actual events by storing information about specific events in a set of properties. Second, event objects contain a set of methods that allow you to manipulate event objects and affect the behavior of the event-handling system.\nTo facilitate access to these properties and methods, the OpenFL API defines an Event class that serves as the base class for all event objects. The Event class defines a fundamental set of properties and methods that are common to all event objects.\nThis section begins with a discussion of the Event class properties, continues with a description of the Event class methods, and concludes with an explanation of why subclasses of the Event class exist.\nUnderstanding Event class properties\nThe Event class defines a number of read-only properties and constants that provide important information about an event object.The following are especially important:\n\nEvent object types are represented by constants and stored in the Event.type property.\nWhether an event’s default behavior can be prevented is represented by a Boolean value and stored in the Event.cancelable property.\n\nEvent flow information is contained in the remaining properties.\n\n\nEvent object types\nEvery event object has an associated event type. Event types are stored in the Event.type property as string values. It is useful to know the type of an event object so that your code can distinguish objects of different types from one another. For example, the following code specifies that the clickHandler() listener function should respond to any mouse click event objects that are passed to myDisplayObject:\nmyDisplayObject.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\nSome two dozen event types are associated with the Event class itself and are represented by Event class constants, some of which are shown in the following excerpt from the Event class definition:\npackage openfl.events;\n\nclass Event {\n\n    // class constants\n\n    public static inline var ACTIVATE = \"activate\";\n    public static inline var ADDED = \"added\";\n\n    // remaining constants omitted for brevity\n\n}\n\nThese constants provide an easy way to refer to specific event types. You should use these constants instead of the strings they represent. If you misspell a constant name in your code, the compiler will catch the mistake, but if you instead use strings, a typographical error may not manifest at compile time and could lead to unexpected behavior that could be difficult to debug. For example, when adding an event listener, use the following code:\nmyDisplayObject.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\nrather than:\nmyDisplayObject.addEventListener (\"click\", clickHandler);\n\nDefault behavior information\nYour code can check whether the default behavior for any given event object can be prevented by accessing the cancelable property. The cancelable property holds a Boolean value that indicates whether or not a default behavior can be prevented. You can prevent, or cancel, the default behavior associated with a small number of events using the preventDefault() method. For more information, see Canceling default event behavior under Understanding Event class methods.\nEvent flow information\nThe remaining Event class properties contain important information about an event object and its relationship to the event flow, as described in the following list:\n\nThe bubbles property contains information about the parts of the event flow in which the event object participates.\nThe eventPhase property indicates the current phase in the event flow.\nThe target property stores a reference to the event target.\nThe currentTarget property stores a reference to the display list object that is currently processing the event object.\n\nThe bubbles property\nAn event is said to bubble if its event object participates in the bubbling phase of the event flow, which means that the event object is passed from the target node back through its ancestors until it reaches the Stage. The Event.bubbles property stores a Boolean value that indicates whether the event object participates in the bubbling phase. Because all events that bubble also participate in the capture and target phases, any event that bubbles participates in all three of the event flow phases. If the value is true, the event object participates in all three phases. If the value is false, the event object does not participate in the bubbling phase.\nThe eventPhase property\nYou can determine the event phase for any event object by investigating its eventPhase property. The eventPhase property contains an unsigned integer value that represents one of the three phases of the event flow. The OpenFL API defines a separate EventPhase class that contains three constants that correspond to the three unsigned integer values, as shown in the following code excerpt:\npackage openfl.events;\n\n@:enum abstract EventPhase(Int) from Int to Int from UInt to UInt {\n\n    public var AT_TARGET = 2;\n    public var BUBBLING_PHASE = 3;\n    public var CAPTURING_PHASE = 1;\n\n}\n\nThese constants correspond to the three valid values of the eventPhase property. You can use these constants to make your code more readable. For example, if you want to ensure that a function named myFunc() is called only if the event target is in the target stage, you can use the following code to test for this condition:\nif (event.eventPhase == EventPhase.AT_TARGET) {\n\n    myFunc ();\n\n}\n\nThe target property\nThe target property holds a reference to the object that is the target of the event. In some cases, this is straightforward, such as when a microphone becomes active, the target of the event object is the Microphone object. If the target is on the display list, however, the display list hierarchy must be taken into account. For example, if a user inputs a mouse click on a point that includes overlapping display list objects, OpenFL always choose the object that is farthest away from the Stage as the event target.\nFor complex projects, especially those in which buttons are routinely decorated with smaller child objects, the target property may not be used frequently because it will often point to a button’s child object instead of the button. In these situations, the common practice is to add event listeners to the button and use the currentTarget property because it points to the button, whereas the target property may point to a child of the button.\nThe currentTarget property\nThe currentTarget property contains a reference to the object that is currently processing the event object. Although it may seem odd not to know which node is currently processing the event object that you are examining, keep in mind that you can add a listener function to any display object in that event object's event flow, and the listener function can be placed in any location. Moreover, the same listener function can be added to different display objects. As a project increases in size and complexity, the currentTarget property becomes more and more useful.\nUnderstanding Event class methods \nThere are three categories of Event class methods:\n\nUtility methods, which can create copies of an event object or convert it to a string\nEvent flow methods, which remove event objects from the event flow\nDefault behavior methods, which prevent default behavior or check whether it has been prevented\n\nEvent class utility methods\nThere are two utility methods in the Event class. The clone() method allows you to create copies of an event object. The toString() method allows you to generate a string representation of the properties of an event object along with their values. Both of these methods are used internally by the event model system, but are exposed to developers for general use.\nFor advanced developers creating subclasses of the Event class, you must override and implement versions of both utility methods to ensure that the event subclass will work properly.\nStopping event flow\nYou can call either the Event.stopPropagation() method or the Event.stopImmediatePropagation() method to prevent an event object from continuing on its way through the event flow. The two methods are nearly identical and differ only in whether the current node’s other event listeners are allowed to execute:\n\nThe Event.stopPropagation() method prevents the event object from moving on to the next node, but only after any other event listeners on the current node are allowed to execute.\nThe Event.stopImmediatePropagation() method also prevents the event object from moving on to the next node, but does not allow any other event listeners on the current node to execute.\n\nCalling either of these methods has no effect on whether the default behavior associated with an event occurs. Use the default behavior methods of the Event class to prevent default behavior.\nCanceling default event behavior\nThe two methods that pertain to canceling default behavior are the preventDefault() method and the isDefaultPrevented() method. Call the preventDefault() method to cancel the default behavior associated with an event. To check whether preventDefault() has already been called on an event object, call the isDefaultPrevented() method, which returns a value of true if the method has already been called and false otherwise.\nThe preventDefault() method will work only if the event’s default behavior can be cancelled. You can check whether this is the case by referring to the API documentation for that event type, or by using Haxe to examine the cancelable property of the event object.\nCanceling the default behavior has no effect on the progress of an event object through the event flow. Use the event flow methods of the Event class to remove an event object from the event flow.\nSubclasses of the Event class \nFor many events, the common set of properties defined in the Event class is sufficient. Other events, however, have unique characteristics that cannot be captured by the properties available in the Event class. For these events, OpenFL defines several subclasses of the Event class.\nEach subclass provides additional properties and event types that are unique to that category of events. For example, events related to mouse input have several unique characteristics that cannot be captured by the properties defined in the Event class. The MouseEvent class extends the Event class by adding ten properties that contain information such as the location of the mouse event and whether specific keys were pressed during the mouse event.\nAn Event subclass also contains constants that represent the event types that are associated with the subclass. For example, the MouseEvent class defines constants for several mouse event types, include the click, doubleClick, mouseDown, and mouseUp event types.\nAs described in the section on Event class utility methods under Event objects, when creating an Event subclass you must override the clone() and toString() methods to provide functionality specific to the subclass.\n"},"handling-events/event-listeners.html":{"url":"handling-events/event-listeners.html","title":"Event listeners","keywords":"","body":"Event listeners \nEvent listeners, which are also called event handlers, are functions that OpenFL executes in response to specific events. Adding an event listener is a two-step process. First, you create a function or class method for OpenFL to execute in response to the event. This is sometimes called the listener function or the event handler function. Second, you use the addEventListener() method to register your listener function with the target of the event or any display list object that lies along the appropriate event flow.\nCreating a listener function\nThe creation of listener functions is one area where the OpenFL event model deviates from the DOM event model. In the DOM event model, there is a clear distinction between an event listener and a listener function: an event listener is an instance of a class that implements the EventListener interface, whereas a listener function is a method of that class named handleEvent(). In the DOM event model, you register the class instance that contains the listener function rather than the actual listener function.\nIn the OpenFL event model, there is no distinction between an event listener and a listener function. OpenFL does not have an EventListener interface, and listener functions can be defined outside a class or as part of a class. Moreover, listener functions do not have to be named handleEvent()—they can be named with any valid identifier. In OpenFL, you register the name of the actual listener function.\nListener function defined as a local function\nThe following code creates a simple project that displays a red square shape. A listener function named clickHandler(), which is not part of a class, listens for mouse click events on the red square.\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass ClickExample extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var child = new ChildSprite ();\n        addChild (child);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass ChildSprite extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\n        graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\n        graphics.endFill ();\n\n        var clickHandler = function (event:MouseEvent) {\n\n            trace (\"clickHandler detected an event of type: \" + event.type);\n            trace (\"the this keyword refers to: \" + this);\n\n        }\n\n        addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWhen a user interacts with the resulting project by clicking on the square, OpenFL generates the following trace output:\nclickHandler detected an event of type: click\nthe this keyword refers to: [object ChildSprite]\nNotice that the event object is passed as an argument to clickHandler(). This allows your listener function to examine the event object. In this example, you use the event object's type property to ascertain that the event is a click event.\nThe example also checks the value of the this keyword. In this case, this represents the Sprite object, because Haxe preserves the scope when creating functions.\nListener function defined as a class method\nThe following example is identical to the previous example that defines the ClickExample class except that the clickHandler() function is defined as a method of the ChildSprite class:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass ClickExample extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var child = new ChildSprite ();\n        addChild (child);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass ChildSprite extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\n        graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\n        graphics.endFill ();\n\n        addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\n    }\n\n    private function clickHandler (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n        trace (\"clickHandler detected an event of type: \" + event.type);\n        trace (\"the this keyword refers to: \" + this);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWhen a user interacts with the resulting project by clicking on the red square, OpenFL generates the following trace output:\nclickHandler detected an event of type: click\nthe this keyword refers to: [object ChildSprite]\nManaging event listeners \nYou can manage your listener functions using the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface. The IEventDispatcher interface is the OpenFL version of the EventTarget interface of the DOM event model. Although the name IEventDispatcher may seem to imply that its main purpose is to send (or dispatch) event objects, the methods of this class are actually used much more frequently to register event listeners, check for event listeners, and remove event listeners. The IEventDispatcher interface defines five methods, as shown in the following code:\npackage openfl.events;\n\ninterface IEventDispatcher {\n\n    public function addEventListener (type:String, listener:Dynamic->Void, useCapture:Bool = false, priority:Int = 0, useWeakReference:Bool = false):Void;\n    public function dispatchEvent (event:Event):Bool;\n    public function hasEventListener (type:String):Bool;\n    public function removeEventListener (type:String, listener:Dynamic->Void, useCapture:Bool = false):Void;\n    public function willTrigger (type:String):Bool;\n\n}\n\nThe OpenFL API implements the IEventDispatcher interface with the EventDispatcher class, which serves as a base class for all classes that can be event targets or part of an event flow. For example, the DisplayObject class inherits from the EventDispatcher class. This means that any object on the display list has access to the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.\nAdding event listeners\nThe addEventListener() method is the workhorse of the IEventDispatcher interface. You use it to register your listener functions. The two required parameters are type and listener. You use the type parameter to specify the type of event. You use the listener parameter to specify the listener function that will execute when the event occurs. The listener parameter can be a reference to either a function or a class method.\nDo not use parentheses when you specify the listener parameter. For example, the clickHandler() function is specified without parentheses in the following call to the addEventListener() method:\naddEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\nThe useCapture parameter of the addEventListener() method allows you to control the event flow phase on which your listener will be active. If useCapture is set to true, your listener will be active during the capture phase of the event flow. If useCapture is set to false, your listener will be active during the target and bubbling phases of the event flow. To listen for an event during all phases of the event flow, you must call addEventListener() twice, once with useCapture set to true, and then again with useCapture set to false.\nThe priority parameter of the addEventListener() method is not an official part of the DOM Level 3 event model. It is included in OpenFL to provide you with more flexibility in organizing your event listeners. When you call addEventListener(), you can set the priority for that event listener by passing an integer value as the priority parameter. The default value is 0, but you can set it to negative or positive integer values. The higher the number, the sooner that event listener will be executed. Event listeners with the same priority are executed in the order that they were added, so the earlier a listener is added, the sooner it will be executed.\nThe useWeakReference parameter allows you to specify whether the reference to the listener function is weak or normal. Setting this parameter to true allows you to avoid situations in which listener functions persist in memory even though they are no longer needed. OpenFL use a technique called garbage collection to clear objects from memory that are no longer in use. An object is considered no longer in use if no references to it exist. The garbage collector disregards weak references, which means that a listener function that has only a weak reference pointing to it is eligible for garbage collection.\n\nThe useWeakReference parameter is currently disregarded, as JavaScript (and other OpenFL target platforms) do not support weak memory references. Do not rely upon this parameter—instead you should remove event listeners to allow garbage collection.\n\nRemoving event listeners\nYou can use the removeEventListener() method to remove an event listener that you no longer need. It is a good idea to remove any listeners that will no longer be used. Required parameters include the eventName and listener parameters, which are the same as the required parameters for the addEventListener() method. Recall that you can listen for events during all event phases by calling addEventListener() twice, once with useCapture set to true, and then again with it set to false. To remove both event listeners, you would need to call removeEventListener() twice, once with useCapture set to true, and then again with it set to false.\nDispatching events\nThe dispatchEvent() method can be used by advanced programmers to dispatch a custom event object into the event flow. The only parameter accepted by this method is a reference to an event object, which must be an instance of the Event class or a subclass of the Event class. Once dispatched, the target property of the event object is set to the object on which dispatchEvent() was called.\nChecking for existing event listeners\nThe final two methods of the IEventDispatcher interface provide useful information about the existence of event listeners. The hasEventListener() method returns true if an event listener is found for a specific event type on a particular display list object. The willTrigger() method also returns true if a listener is found for a particular display list object, but willTrigger() checks for listeners not only on that display object, but also on all of that display list object’s ancestors for all phases of the event flow.\nError events without listeners \nExceptions, rather than events, are the primary mechanism for error handling in Haxe, but exception handling does not work for asynchronous operations such as loading files. If an error occurs during such an asynchronous operation, OpenFL dispatches an error event object. If you do not create a listener for the error event, the debugger versions of Flash Player will bring up a dialog box with information about the error, or messages will be displayed in console output on other platforms. For example, the debugger version of Flash Player produces the following dialog box describing the error when the application attempts to load a file from an invalid URL:\n\nMost error events are based on the ErrorEvent class, and as such will have a property named text that is used to store the error message that OpenFL displays. The two exceptions are the StatusEvent and NetStatusEvent classes. Both of these classes have a level property (StatusEvent.level and NetStatusEvent.info.level).\nWhen the value of the level property is \"error\", these event types are considered to be error events.\nAn error event will not cause dynamic platforms (such as HTML5 or Flash Player) to stop running, but will stop execution on all other platforms. It will manifest as a dialog box on the debugger versions of Flash Player, and will not manifest in release versions of Flash Player.\n"},"display-programming/":{"url":"display-programming/","title":"Chapter 2: Display programming","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2: Display programming \nVisual elements are programmed in Haxe by working with display objects on the display stage. For example, you can add, move, remove, and order display objects, apply filters and masks, draw vector and bitmap graphics, and perform three-dimensional transformations using the OpenFL display programming API. The primary classes used for display programming are part of the openfl.display package.\nSection Contents\n\nBasics of display programming\nCore display classes\nAdvantages of the display list approach\nWorking with display objects\nManipulating display objects\nAnimating objects\nLoading display content dynamically\n\n"},"display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html":{"url":"display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html","title":"Basics of display programming","keywords":"","body":"Basics of display programming \nEach application built with OpenFL has a hierarchy of displayed objects known as the display list, illustrated below. The display list contains all the visible elements in the application.\n\nAs the illustration shows, display elements fall into one or more of the following groups:\n\nThe Stage\nThe Stage is the base container of display objects. Each application has one Stage object, which contains all on-screen display objects. The Stage is the top-level container and is at the top of the display list hierarchy:\nEach project has an associated Haxe class, known as the main class of the project. When a project opens, OpenFL calls the constructor function for that class and the instance that is created (which is always a type of display object) is added as a child of the Stage object. The main class of a project always extends the Sprite class (for more information, see Advantages of the display list approach.\nYou can access the Stage through the stage property of any DisplayObject instance. For more information, see Setting Stage properties.\n\nDisplay objects\nIn Haxe, all elements that appear on screen in an application are types of display objects. The openfl.display package includes a DisplayObject class, which is a base class extended by a number of other classes. These different classes represent different types of display objects, such as vector shapes, movie clips, and text fields, to name a few. For an overview of these classes, see Advantages of the display list approach.\n\nDisplay object containers\nDisplay object containers are special types of display objects that, in addition to having their own visual representation, can also contain child objects that are also display objects.\nThe DisplayObjectContainer class is a subclass of the DisplayObject class. A DisplayObjectContainer object can contain multiple display objects in its childlist. For example, the following illustration shows a type of DisplayObjectContainer object known as a Sprite that contains various display objects:\n\nA. A SimpleButton object. This type of display object has different \"up,\" \"down,\" and \"over\" states. B. A Bitmap object. In this case, the Bitmap object was loaded from an external JPEG through a Loader object. C. A Shape object. The \"picture frame\" contains a rounded rectangle that is drawn in Haxe. This Shape object has a Drop Shadow filter applied to it. D. A TextField object.\nIn the context of discussing display objects, DisplayObjectContainer objects are also known as display object containers or simply containers. As noted earlier, the Stage is a display object container.\nAlthough all visible display objects inherit from the DisplayObject class, the type of each is of a specific subclass of DisplayObject class. For example, there is a constructor function for the Shape class or the Video class, but there is no constructor function for the DisplayObject class.\n\n\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter when programming OpenFL graphics:\nAlpha The color value representing the amount of transparency (or more correctly, the amount of opacity) in a color. For example, a color with an alpha channel value of 60% only shows 60% of its full strength, and is 40% transparent.\nBitmap graphic A graphic that is defined in the computer as a grid (rows and columns) of colored pixels. Commonly bitmap graphics include digital photos and similar images.\nBlending mode A specification of how the contents of two overlapping images should interact. Commonly an opaque image on top of another image simply blocks the image underneath so that it isn’t visible at all; however, different blending modes cause the colors of the images to blend together in different ways so the resulting content is some combination of the two images.\nDisplay list The hierarchy of display objects that will be rendered as visible screen content by OpenFL. The Stage is the root of the display list, and all the display objects that are attached to the Stage or one of its children form the display list (even if the object isn’t actually rendered, for example if it’s outside the boundaries of the Stage).\nDisplay object An object which represents some type of visual content in OpenFL. Only display objects can be included in the display list, and all display object classes are subclasses of the DisplayObject class.\nDisplay object container A special type of display object which can contain child display objects in addition to (generally) having its own visual representation.\nMain class of the project The class that defines the behavior for the outermost display object in a project, which conceptually is the class for the project itself. This is the entry point for each project.\nMasking A technique of hiding from view certain parts of an image (or conversely, only allowing certain parts of an image to display). The portions of the mask image become transparent, so content underneath shows through. The term is related to painter’s masking tape that is used to prevent paint from being applied to certain areas.\nStage The visual container that is the base or background of all visual content in a SWF.\nTransformation An adjustment to a visual characteristic of a graphic, such as rotating the object, altering its scale, skewing or distorting its shape, or altering its color.\nVector graphic A graphic that is defined in the computer as lines and shapes drawn with particular characteristics (such as thickness, length, size, angle, and position).\n"},"display-programming/core-display-classes.html":{"url":"display-programming/core-display-classes.html","title":"Core display classes","keywords":"","body":"Core display classes \nThe openfl.display package includes classes for visual objects that can appear in OpenFL. The following illustration shows the subclass relationships of these core display object classes.\n\nThe illustration shows the class inheritance of display object classes. Note that some of these classes, specifically StaticText, TextField, and Video, are not in the openfl.display package, but they still inherit from the DisplayObject class.\nAll classes that extend the DisplayObject class inherit its methods and properties. For more information, see Properties and methods of the DisplayObject class.\nYou can instantiate objects of the following classes contained in the openfl.display package:\n\nBitmap—You use the Bitmap class to define bitmap objects, either loaded from external files or rendered through Haxe. You can load bitmaps from external files through the Loader class. You can load GIF, JPG, or PNG files. You can also create a BitmapData object with custom data and then create a Bitmap object that uses that data. You can use the methods of the BitmapData class to alter bitmaps, whether they are loaded or created in Haxe. For more information, see Loading display objects and Working with bitmaps.\n\nLoader—You use the Loader class to load external assets (either projects or graphics). For more information, see Loading display content dynamically.\n\nShape—You use the Shape class to create vector graphics, such as rectangles, lines, circles, and so on. For more information, see Using the drawing API.\n\nSimpleButton—A SimpleButton object is the OpenFL representation of a button symbol created in the Flash authoring tool. A SimpleButton instance has four button states: up, down, over, and hit test (the area that responds to mouse and keyboard events).\n\nSprite—A Sprite object can contain graphics of its own, and it can contain child display objects. (The Sprite class extends the DisplayObjectContainer class). For more information, see Working with display object containers and Using the drawing API.\n\nMovieClip—A MovieClip object is the OpenFL form of a movie clip symbol created in the Flash authoring tool. In practice, a MovieClip is similar to a Sprite object, except that it also has a timeline. For more information, see Working with movie clips.\n\n\nThe following classes, which are not in the openfl.display package, are subclasses of the DisplayObject class:\n\nThe TextField class, included in the openfl.text package, is a display object for text display and input. For more information, see Basics of Working with text.\n\n\n\nThe Video class, included in the openfl.media package, is the display object used for displaying video files. For more information, see Working with video.\n\nThe following classes in the openfl.display package extend the DisplayObject class, but you cannot create instances of them. Instead, they serve as parent classes for other display objects, combining common functionality into a single class.\n\n\nInteractiveObject—InteractiveObject is the base class for all objects used to interact with the mouse and keyboard. SimpleButton, TextField, Loader, Sprite, Stage, and MovieClip objects are all subclasses of the InteractiveObject class. For more information on creating mouse and keyboard interaction, see Basics of user interaction.\n\nMorphShape—These objects are created when you create a shape tween in the Flash authoring tool. You cannot instantiate them using Haxe, but they can be accessed from the display list.\n\nStage—The Stage class extends the DisplayObjectContainer class. There is one Stage instance for an application, and it is at the top of the display list hierarchy. To access the Stage, use the stage property of any DisplayObject instance. For more information, see Setting Stage properties.\n\n\nAlso, the StaticText class, in the openfl.text package, extends the DisplayObject class, but you cannot create an instance of it in code. Static text fields are created only in SWF-based assets.\n"},"display-programming/advantages-of-the-display-list-approach.html":{"url":"display-programming/advantages-of-the-display-list-approach.html","title":"Advantages of the display list approach","keywords":"","body":"Advantages of the display list approach \nIn OpenFL, there are separate classes for different types of display objects. In ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, many of the same types of objects are all included in one class: the MovieClip class.\nThis individualization of classes and the hierarchical structure of display lists have the following benefits:\n\nMore efficient rendering and reduced memory usage\nImproved depth management\nFull traversal of the display list\nOff-list display objects\nEasier subclassing of display objects\n\nMore efficient rendering and smaller file sizes\nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, you could draw shapes only in a MovieClip object. In OpenFL, there are simpler display object classes in which you can draw shapes. Because these OpenFL display object classes do not include the full set of methods and properties that a MovieClip object includes, they are less taxing on memory and processor resources.\nFor example, each MovieClip object includes properties for the timeline of the movie clip, whereas a Shape object does not. The properties for managing the timeline can use a lot of memory and processor resources. In OpenFL, using the Shape object results in better performance. The Shape object has less overhead than the more complex MovieClip object. OpenFL does not need to manage unused MovieClip properties, which improves speed and reduces the memory footprint the object uses.\nImproved depth management \nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, depth was managed through a linear depth management scheme and methods such as getNextHighestDepth().\nOpenFL includes the DisplayObjectContainer class, which has more convenient methods and properties for managing the depth of display objects.\nIn OpenFL, when you move a display object to a new position in the child list of a DisplayObjectContainer instance, the other children in the display object container are repositioned automatically and assigned appropriate child index positions in the display object container.\nAlso, in OpenFL it is always possible to discover all of the child objects of any display object container. Every DisplayObjectContainer instance has a numChildren property, which lists the number of children in the display object container. And since the child list of a display object container is always an indexed list, you can examine every object in the list from index position 0 through the last index position (numChildren - 1). This was not possible with the methods and properties of a MovieClip object in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0.\nIn OpenFL, you can easily traverse the display list sequentially; there are no gaps in the index numbers of a child list of a display object container. Traversing the display list and managing the depth of objects is much easier than was possible in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. In ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, a movie clip could contain objects with intermittent gaps in the depth order, which could make it difficult to traverse the list of object. In OpenFL, each child list of a display object container is cached internally as an array, resulting in very fast lookups (by index). Looping through all children of a display object container is also very fast.\nIn OpenFL, you can also access children in a display object container by using the getChildByName() method of the DisplayObjectContainer class.\nFull traversal of the display list \nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, you could not access some objects, such as vector shapes, that were drawn in the Flash authoring tool. In OpenFL, you can access all objects on the display list—both those created using OpenFL and all display objects created in the Flash authoring tool. For details, see Traversing the display list.\nOff-list display objects \nIn OpenFL, you can create display objects that are not on the visible display list. These are known as off-list display objects. A display object is added to the visible display list only when you call the addChild() or addChildAt() method of a DisplayObjectContainer instance that has already been added to the display list.\nYou can use off-list display objects to assemble complex display objects, such as those that have multiple display object containers containing multiple display objects. By keeping display objects off-list, you can assemble complicated objects without using the processing time to render these display objects. You can then add an off-list display object to the display list when it is needed. Also, you can move a child of a display object container on and off the display list and to any desired position in the display list at will.\nEasier subclassing of display objects \nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, you would often have to add new MovieClip objects to a project to create basic shapes or to display bitmaps. In OpenFL, the DisplayObject class includes many built-in subclasses, including Shape and Bitmap. Because the classes in OpenFL are more specialized for specific types of objects, it is easier to create basic subclasses of the built-in classes.\nFor example, in order to draw a circle in ActionScript 2.0, you could create a CustomCircle class that extends the MovieClip class when an object of the custom class is instantiated. However, that class would also include a number of properties and methods from the MovieClip class (such as totalFrames) that do not apply to the class. In OpenFL, however, you can create a CustomCircle class that extends the Shape object, and as such does not include the unrelated properties and methods that are contained in the MovieClip class. The following code shows an example of a CustomCircle class:\nimport openfl.display.*;\n\nclass CustomCircle extends Shape {\n\n    private var xPos:Float;\n    private var yPos:Float;\n    private var radius:Float;\n    private var color:Int;\n\n    public function new (xInput:Float, yInput:Float, rInput:Float, colorInput:Int) {\n\n        xPos = xInput;\n        yPos = yInput;\n        radius = rInput;\n        color = colorInput;\n\n        this.graphics.beginFill (color);\n        this.graphics.drawCircle (xPos, yPos, radius);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/","title":"Working with display objects","keywords":"","body":"Working with display objects \nNow that you understand the basic concepts of the Stage, display objects, display object containers, and the display list, this section provides you with some more specific information about working with display objects in OpenFL.\nSection Contents\n\nProperties and methods of the DisplayObject classs\nAdding display objects to the display list\nWorking with display object containers\nTraversing the display list\nSetting Stage properties\nHandling events for display objects\nChoosing a DisplayObject subclass\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/properties-and-methods-of-the-displayobject-class.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/properties-and-methods-of-the-displayobject-class.html","title":"Properties and methods of the DisplayObject class","keywords":"","body":"Properties and methods of the DisplayObject class \nAll display objects are subclasses of the DisplayObject class, and as such they inherit the properties and methods of the DisplayObject class.

You must create another type of object (an object that is a subclass of the DisplayObject class), such as a Sprite, to instantiate an object with the new operator. Also, if you want to create a custom display object class, you must create a subclass of one of the display object subclasses that has a usable constructor function (such as the Shape class or the Sprite class).

It can be an object of any type that extends the Sprite class.\nAny display objects that you create without using Haxe—for example, by placing an item on the Stage in Adobe Animate—are added to the display list. Although you do not add these display objects through Haxe, you can access them through Haxe. For example, the following code adjusts the width of an object named button1 that was added in the authoring tool (not through Haxe):\nbutton1.width = 200;\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/working-with-display-object-containers.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/working-with-display-object-containers.html","title":"Working with display object containers","keywords":"","body":"Working with display object containers \nIf a DisplayObjectContainer object is deleted from the display list, or if it is moved or transformed in some other way, each display object in the DisplayObjectContainer is also deleted, moved, or transformed.\nA display object container is itself a type of display object—it can be added to another display object container. For example, the following image shows a display object container, pictureScreen, that contains one outline shape and four other display object containers (of type PictureFrame):\n\nA. A shape defining the border of the pictureScreen display object container B. Four display object containers that are children of the pictureScreen object\nIn order to have a display object appear in the display list, you must add it to a display object container that is on the display list. You do this by using the addChild() method or the addChildAt() method of the container object. For example, without the final line of the following code, the myTextField object would not be displayed:\nvar myTextField = new TextField ();\nmyTextField.text = \"hello\";\nthis.root.addChild (myTextField);\n\nIn this code sample, this.root points to the MovieClip display object container that contains the code. In your actual code, you may specify a different container.\nUse the addChildAt() method to add the child to a specific position in the child list of the display object container. These zero-based index positions in the child list relate to the layering (the front-to-back order) of the display objects. For example, consider the following three display objects. Each object was created from a custom class called Ball.\n\nThe layering of these display objects in their container can be adjusted using the addChildAt() method. For example, consider the following code:\nball_A = new Ball (0xFFCC00, \"a\");\nball_A.name = \"ball_A\";\nball_A.x = 20;\nball_A.y = 20;\ncontainer.addChild (ball_A);\n\nball_B = new Ball (0xFFCC00, \"b\");\nball_B.name = \"ball_B\";\nball_B.x = 70;\nball_B.y = 20;\ncontainer.addChild (ball_B);\n\nball_C = new Ball (0xFFCC00, \"c\");\nball_C.name = \"ball_C\";\nball_C.x = 40;\nball_C.y = 60;\ncontainer.addChildAt (ball_C, 1);\n\nAfter executing this code, the display objects are positioned as follows in the container DisplayObjectContainer object. Notice the layering of the objects.\n\nTo reposition an object to the top of the display list, simply re-add it to the list. For example, after the previous code, to move ball_A to the top of the stack, use this line of code:\ncontainer.addChild (ball_A);\n\nThis code effectively removes ball_A from its location in container’s display list, and re-adds it to the top of the list—which has the end result of moving it to the top of the stack.\nYou can use the getChildAt() method to verify the layer order of the display objects. The getChildAt() method returns child objects of a container based on the index number you pass it. For example, the following code reveals names of display objects at different positions in the child list of the container DisplayObjectContainer object:\ntrace (container.getChildAt (0).name); // ball_A\ntrace (container.getChildAt (1).name); // ball_C\ntrace (container.getChildAt (2).name); // ball_B\n\nIf you remove a display object from the parent container’s child list, the higher elements on the list each move down a position in the child index. For example, continuing with the previous code, the following code shows how the display object that was at position 2 in the container DisplayObjectContainer moves to position 1 if a display object that is lower in the child list is removed:\ncontainer.removeChild (ball_C);\ntrace (container.getChildAt (0).name); // ball_A\ntrace (container.getChildAt (1).name); // ball_B\n\nThe removeChild() and removeChildAt() methods do not delete a display object instance entirely. They simply remove it from the child list of the container. The instance can still be referenced by another variable. \nBecause a display object has only one parent container, you can add an instance of a display object to only one display object container. For example, the following code shows that the display object tf1 can exist in only one container (in this case, a Sprite, which extends the DisplayObjectContainer class):\ntf1 = new TextField ();\ntf2 = new TextField ();\ntf1.name = \"text 1\";\ntf2.name = \"text 2\";\n\ncontainer1 = new Sprite ();\ncontainer2 = new Sprite ();\n\ncontainer1.addChild (tf1);\ncontainer1.addChild (tf2);\ncontainer2.addChild (tf1);\n\ntrace (container1.numChildren); // 1\ntrace (container1.getChildAt (0).name); // text 2\ntrace (container2.numChildren); // 1\ntrace (container2.getChildAt(0).name); // text 1\n\nIf you add a display object that is contained in one display object container to another display object container, it is removed from the first display object container’s child list.\nIn addition to the methods described above, the DisplayObjectContainer class defines several methods for working with child display objects, including the following:\n\ncontains(): Determines whether a display object is a child of a DisplayObjectContainer.\ngetChildByName(): Retrieves a display object by name.\ngetChildIndex(): Returns the index position of a display object.\nsetChildIndex(): Changes the position of a child display object.\nremoveChildren(): Removes multiple child display objects.\nswapChildren(): Swaps the front-to-back order of two display objects.\nswapChildrenAt(): Swaps the front-to-back order of two display objects, specified by their index values. \n\nFor more information, see the relevant entries in the API Reference.\nRecall that a display object that is off the display list—one that is not included in a display object container that is a child of the Stage—is known as an off-list display object.\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/traversing-the-display-list.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/traversing-the-display-list.html","title":"Traversing the display list","keywords":"","body":"Traversing the display list \nAs you’ve seen, the display list is a tree structure. At the top of the tree is the Stage, which can contain multiple display objects. Those display objects that are themselves display object containers can contain other display objects, or display object containers.\n\nThe DisplayObjectContainer class includes properties and methods for traversing the display list, by means of the child lists of display object containers. For example, consider the following code, which adds two display objects, title and pict, to the container object (which is a Sprite, and the Sprite class extends the DisplayObjectContainer class):\nvar container = new Sprite();\n\nvar title = new TextField ();\ntitle.text = \"Hello\";\n\nvar pict = new Loader ();\nvar url = new URLRequest (\"banana.jpg\");\npict.load (url);\npict.name = \"banana loader\";\n\ncontainer.addChild (title);\ncontainer.addChild (pict);\n\nThe getChildAt() method returns the child of the display list at a specific index position:\ntrace (Std.is (container.getChildAt (0), TextField)); // true\n\nYou can also access child objects by name. Each display object has a name property, and if you don’t assign it, OpenFL assigns a default value, such as \"instance1\". For example, the following code shows how to use the getChildByName() method to access a child display object with the name \"banana loader\":\ntrace (Std.is (container.getChildByName (\"banana\"), Loader)); // true\n\nUsing the getChildByName() method can result in slower performance than using the getChildAt() method.\nSince a display object container can contain other display object containers as child objects in its display list, you can traverse the full display list of the application as a tree. For example, in the code excerpt shown earlier, once the load operation for the pict Loader object is complete, the pict object will have one child display object, which is the bitmap, loaded. To access this bitmap display object, you can write pict.getChildAt (0). You can also write container.getChildAt (0).getChildAt (0) (since container.getChildAt (0) == pict).\nThe following function provides an indented trace() output of the display list from a display object container:\npublic function traceDisplayList (container:DisplayObjectContainer, indentString:String = \"\"):Void {\n\n    var child:DisplayObject;\n\n    for (i in 0...container.numChildren) {\n\n        child = container.getChildAt (i);\n        trace (indentString + child + child.name);\n\n        if (Std.is (container.getChildAt (i), DisplayObjectContainer)) {\n\n            traceDisplayList (cast (child, DisplayObjectContainer), indentString + \"    \");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/setting-stage-properties.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/setting-stage-properties.html","title":"Setting Stage properties","keywords":"","body":"Setting Stage properties \nThe Stage class overrides most properties and methods of the DisplayObject class. If you call one of these overridden properties or methods, OpenFL will ignore the request. For example, the Stage object does not have x or y properties, since its position is fixed as the main container for the application. The x and y properties refer to the position of a display object relative to its container, and since the Stage is not contained in another display object container, these properties do not apply.\n\nControlling the playback frame rate\nThe frameRate property of the Stage class is used to set the frame rate for all projects loaded into the application. For more information, see the API Reference.\nControlling Stage scaling\nWhen the portion of the screen representing OpenFL is resized, the runtime automatically adjusts the Stage contents to compensate. The Stage class’s scaleMode property determines how the Stage contents are adjusted. This property can be set to four different values, defined as constants in the openfl.display.StageScaleMode class:\n\nStageScaleMode.EXACT_FIT scales the project to fill the new stage dimensions without regard for the original content aspect ratio. The scale factors might not be the same for width and height, so the content can appear squeezed or stretched if the aspect ratio of the stage is changed.\nStageScaleMode.SHOW_ALL scales the project to fit entirely within the new stage dimensions without changing the content aspect ratio. This scale mode displays all of the content, but can result in \"letterbox\" borders, like the black bars that appear when viewing a wide-screen movie on a standard television.\nStageScaleMode.NO_BORDER scales the project to entirely fill the new stage dimensions without changing the aspect ratio of the content. This scale mode makes full use of the stage display area, but can result in cropping.\nStageScaleMode.NO_SCALE — does not scale the project. If the new stage dimensions are smaller, the content is cropped; if larger, the added space is blank.\n\n\nOn Flash Player, OpenFL will respect the above StageScaleMode settings, but on other platforms, OpenFL will behave like StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE by default, or StageScaleMode.SHOW_ALL if you set a window width and height in your project file\n\nIn the StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE scale mode only, the stageWidth and stageHeight properties of the Stage class can be used to determine the actual pixel dimensions of the resized stage. (In the other scale modes, the stageWidth and stageHeight properties always reflect the original width and height of the project.) In addition, when scaleMode is set to StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE and the project is resized, the Stage class’s resize event is dispatched, allowing you to make adjustments accordingly.\nConsequently, having scaleMode set to StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE allows you to have greater control over how the screen contents adjust to the window resizing if you desire. For example, in a project containing a video and a control bar, you might want to make the control bar stay the same size when the Stage is resized, and only change the size of the video window to accommodate the Stage size change. This is demonstrated in the following example:\n// mainContent is a display object containing the main content;\n// it is positioned at the top-left corner of the Stage, and\n// it should resize when the window resizes.\n// controlBar is a display object (e.g. a Sprite) containing several\n// buttons; it should stay positioned at the bottom-left corner of the\n// Stage (below mainContent) and it should not resize when the project\n// resizes.\n\nimport openfl.display.Stage;\nimport openfl.display.StageAlign;\nimport openfl.display.StageScaleMode;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\n\n...\n\nvar stage = mainContent.stage;\nstage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;\nstage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;\nstage.addEventListener (Event.RESIZE, resizeDisplay);\n\n...\n\nprivate function resizeDisplay (event:Event):Void {\n\n    var width = stage.stageWidth;\n    var height = stage.stageHeight;\n\n    // Resize the main content area\n    var newContentHeight = height - controlBar.height;\n    mainContent.height = newContentHeight;\n    mainContent.scaleX = mainContent.scaleY;\n\n    // Reposition the control bar\n    controlBar.y = newContentHeight;\n\n}\n\nWorking with full-screen mode\nFull-screen mode allows you to set a movie’s stage to fill a viewer’s entire monitor without any container borders or menus. The Stage class’s displayState property is used to toggle full-screen mode on and off for an OpenFL project. The displayState property can be set to one of the values defined by the constants in the openfl.display.StageDisplayState class. To turn on full-screen mode, set the displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN:\nstage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN;\n\nTo turn on full-screen interactive mode, set the displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE:\nstage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE;\n\n\nOpenFL allows interactive access for both StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN or StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE on platforms other than Flash\n\nIn Flash Player, full-screen mode can only be initiated through Haxe in response to a mouse click (including right-click) or keypress. Other platforms content do not require that full-screen mode be entered in response to a user gesture.\nTo exit full-screen mode, set the displayState property to StageDisplayState.NORMAL.\nstage.displayState = StageDisplayState.NORMAL;\n\nIn addition, a user can choose to leave full-screen mode by switching focus to a different window or by using one of several key combinations: the Esc key (all platforms), Control-W (Windows), Command-W (Mac), or Alt-F4 (Windows).\nEnabling full-screen mode in Flash Player\nTo enable full-screen mode for a SWF embedded in an HTML page, the HTML code to embed the SWF file must include a param tag and embed attribute with the name allowFullScreen and value true, like this:\n\n    ...\n    \n    \n\n\nIn the Flash authoring tool, select File -> Publish Settings and in the Publish Settings dialog box, on the HTML tab, select the Flash Only - Allow Full Screen template.\nIf you are using JavaScript in a web page to generate the SWF-embedding tags, you must alter the JavaScript to add the allowFullScreen param tag and attribute. For example, if your HTML page uses the AC_FL_RunContent() function (which is used in HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and Flash Builder), you should add the allowFullScreen parameter to that function call as follows:\nAC_FL_RunContent(\n    ...\n    'allowFullScreen','true',\n    ...\n); //end AC code\n\nThis does not apply to projects running in the stand-alone Flash Player.\nNote: If you set the Window Mode (wmode in the HTML) to Opaque Windowless (opaque) or Transparent Windowless (transparent), the full-screen window is always opaque\n\nEnabling full-screen interactive mode in Flash Player 11.3 and higher\nFlash Player 11.3 and higher support full-screen interactive mode, which enables full support for all keyboard keys (except for Esc, which exits full-screen interactive mode). Full-screen interactive mode is useful for gaming (for example, to enable chat in a multi-player game or WASD keyboard controls in a first-person shooter game.)\nTo enable full-screen interactive mode for a project embedded in an HTML page, the HTML code to embed the SWF file must include a param tag and embed attribute with the name allowFullScreenInteractive and value true, like this:\n\n    ...\n    \n    \n\n\nIn the Flash authoring tool, select File -> Publish Settings and in the Publish Settings dialog box, on the HTML tab, select the Flash Only - Allow Full Screen Interactive template.\nIf you are using JavaScript in a web page to generate the SWF-embedding tags, you must alter the JavaScript to add the allowFullScreenInteractive param tag and attribute. For example, if your HTML page uses the AC_FL_RunContent() function (which is used in HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and Flash Builder), you should add the allowFullScreenInteractive parameter to that function call as follows:\nAC_FL_RunContent(\n    ...\n    'allowFullScreenInteractive','true',\n    ...\n); //end AC code\n\nThis does not apply to projects running in the stand-alone Flash Player.\nFull screen stage size and scaling\nThe Stage.fullScreenHeight and Stage.fullScreenWidth properties return the height and the width of the monitor that’s used when going to full-screen size, if that state is entered immediately. These values can be incorrect if the user has the opportunity to move the browser from one monitor to another after you retrieve these values but before entering full-screen mode. If you retrieve these values in the same event handler where you set the Stage.displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN, the values are correct. For users with multiple monitors, the content expands to fill only one monitor. OpenFL uses a metric to determine which monitor contains the greatest portion of the application window, and uses that monitor for full-screen mode. The fullScreenHeight and fullScreenWidth properties only reflect the size of the monitor that is used for full-screen mode. For more information, see Stage.fullScreenHeight and Stage.fullScreenWidth in the API Reference.\nStage scaling behavior for full-screen mode is the same as under normal mode; the scaling is controlled by the Stage class’s scaleMode property. If the scaleMode property is set to StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE, the Stage’s stageWidth and stageHeight properties change to reflect the size of the screen area occupied by the content (the entire screen, in this case); if viewed in the browser the HTML parameter for this controls the setting.\nYou can use the Stage class’s fullScreen event to detect and respond when full-screen mode is turned on or off. For example, you might want to reposition, add, or remove items from the screen when entering or leaving full-screen mode, as in this example:\nimport openfl.events.FullScreenEvent;\n\n...\n\nprivate function fullScreenRedraw (event:FullScreenEvent):Void {\n\n    if (event.fullScreen) {\n\n        // Remove input text fields.\n        // Add a button that closes full-screen mode.\n\n    } else {\n\n        // Re-add input text fields.\n        // Remove the button that closes full-screen mode.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n...\n\nmySprite.stage.addEventListener (FullScreenEvent.FULL_SCREEN, fullScreenRedraw);\n\nAs this code shows, the event object for the fullScreen event is an instance of the openfl.events.FullScreenEvent class, which includes a fullScreen property indicating whether full-screen mode is enabled (true) or not (false).\nKeyboard support in full-screen mode\nWhen Flash Player runs in a browser, all keyboard-related code, such as keyboard events and text entry in TextField instances, is disabled in full-screen mode. The exceptions (the keys that are enabled) are:\n\nSelected non-printing keys, specifically the arrow keys, space bar, and tab key\nKeyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode: Esc (Windows and Mac), Control-W (Windows), Command- W (Mac), and Alt-F4\n\nThese restrictions are not present for Flash content running in the stand-alone Flash Player.\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/handling-events-for-display-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/handling-events-for-display-objects.html","title":"Handling events for display objects","keywords":"","body":"Handling events for display objects \nThe DisplayObject class inherits from the EventDispatcher class. This means that every display object can participate fully in the event model (described in Handling events). Every display object can use its addEventListener() method—inherited from the EventDispatcher class—to listen for a particular event, but only if the listening object is part of the event flow for that event.\nWhen OpenFL dispatches an event object, that event object makes a round-trip journey from the Stage to the display object where the event occurred. For example, if a user clicks on a display object named child1, OpenFL dispatches an event object from the Stage through the display list hierarchy down to the child1 display object.\nThe event flow is conceptually divided into three phases, as illustrated in this diagram:\n\nFor more information, see Handling events.\nOne important issue to keep in mind when working with display object events is the effect that event listeners can have on whether display objects are automatically removed from memory (garbage collected) when they’re removed from the display list. If a display object has objects subscribed as listeners to its events, that display object will not be removed from memory even when it’s removed from the display list, because it will still have references to those listener objects.

To set a display object’s position, change the object’s x and y properties.\nmyShape.x = 17;\nmyShape.y = 212;\n\nThe display object positioning system treats the Stage as a Cartesian coordinate system (the common grid system with a horizontal x axis and vertical y axis). The origin of the coordinate system (the 0,0 coordinate where the x and y axes meet) is at the top-left corner of the Stage. From there, x values are positive going right and negative going left, while (in contrast to typical graphing systems) y values are positive going down and negative going up. For example, the previous lines of code move the object myShape to the x coordinate 17 (17 pixels to the right of the origin) and y coordinate 212 (212 pixels below the origin).\nBy default, when a display object is created using Haxe, the x and y properties are both set to 0, placing the object at the top-left corner of its parent content.\nChanging position relative to the Stage\nIt’s important to remember that the x and y properties always refer to the position of the display object relative to the 0,0 coordinate of its parent display object’s axes. So for a Shape instance (such as a circle) contained inside a Sprite instance, setting the Shape object’s x and y properties to 0 will place the circle at the top-left corner of the Sprite, which is not necessarily the top-left corner of the Stage. To position an object relative to the global Stage coordinates, you can use the globalToLocal() method of any display object to convert coordinates from global (Stage) coordinates to local (display object container) coordinates, like this:\n// Position the shape at the top-left corner of the Stage,\n// regardless of where its parent is located.\n\n// Create a Sprite, positioned at x:200 and y:200.\nvar mySprite = new Sprite ();\nmySprite.x = 200;\nmySprite.y = 200;\nthis.addChild (mySprite);\n\n// Draw a dot at the Sprite's 0,0 coordinate, for reference.\nmySprite.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\nmySprite.graphics.beginFill (0x000000);\nmySprite.graphics.moveTo (0, 0);\nmySprite.graphics.lineTo (1, 0);\nmySprite.graphics.lineTo (1, 1);\nmySprite.graphics.lineTo (0, 1);\nmySprite.graphics.endFill ();\n\n// Create the circle Shape instance.\nvar circle = new Shape ();\nmySprite.addChild (circle);\n\n// Draw a circle with radius 50 and center point at x:50, y:50 in the Shape. circle.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\ncircle.graphics.beginFill (0xff0000);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle (50, 50, 50);\ncircle.graphics.endFill ();\n\n// Move the Shape so its top-left corner is at the Stage's 0, 0 coordinate.\nvar stagePoint = new Point (0, 0);\nvar targetPoint = mySprite.globalToLocal (stagePoint);\ncircle.x = targetPoint.x;\ncircle.y = targetPoint.y;\n\nYou can likewise use the DisplayObject class’s localToGlobal() method to convert local coordinates to Stage coordinates.\nMoving display objects with the mouse\nYou can let a user move display objects with mouse using two different techniques in Haxe. In both cases, two mouse events are used: when the mouse button is pressed down, the object is told to follow the mouse cursor, and when it’s released, the object is told to stop following the mouse cursor.\n\nThe first technique, using the startDrag() method, is simpler, but more limited. When the mouse button is pressed, the startDrag() method of the display object to be dragged is called. When the mouse button is released, the stopDrag() method is called. The Sprite class defines these two functions, so the object moved must be a Sprite or one of its subclasses.\n// This code creates a mouse drag interaction using the startDrag()\n// technique.\n// square is a MovieClip or Sprite instance.\n\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is pressed.\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.startDrag ();\n\n}\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is released.\nprivate function stopDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.stopDrag ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging);\nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\nThis technique suffers from one fairly significant limitation: only one item at a time can be dragged using startDrag(). If one display object is being dragged and the startDrag() method is called on another display object, the first display object stops following the mouse immediately. For example, if the startDragging() function is changed as shown here, only the circle object will be dragged, in spite of the square.startDrag() method call:\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.startDrag ();\n    circle.startDrag ();\n\n}\n\nAs a consequence of the fact that only one object can be dragged at a time using startDrag(), the stopDrag() method can be called on any display object and it stops whatever object is currently being dragged.\nIf you need to drag more than one display object, or to avoid the possibility of conflicts where more than one object might potentially use startDrag(), it’s best to use the mouse-following technique to create the dragging effect. With this technique, when the mouse button is pressed, a function is subscribed as a listener to the mouseMove event of the Stage. This function, which is then called every time the mouse moves, causes the dragged object to jump to the x, y coordinate of the mouse. Once the mouse button is released, the function is unsubscribed as a listener, meaning it is no longer called when the mouse moves and the object stops following the mouse cursor. Here is some code that demonstrates this technique:\n// This code moves display objects using the mouse-following\n// technique.\n// circle is a DisplayObject (e.g. a MovieClip or Sprite instance).\n\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\n...\n\nprivate var offsetX:Float;\nprivate var offsetY:Float;\n\n...\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is pressed.\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Record the difference (offset) between where\n    // the cursor was when the mouse button was pressed and the x, y\n    // coordinate of the circle when the mouse button was pressed.\n    offsetX = event.stageX - circle.x;\n    offsetY = event.stageY - circle.y;\n\n    // tell OpenFL to start listening for the mouseMove event\n    stage.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is released.\nprivate function stopDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Tell OpenFL to stop listening for the mouseMove event.\n    stage.removeEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called every time the mouse moves,\n// as long as the mouse button is pressed down.\nprivate function dragCircle (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Move the circle to the location of the cursor, maintaining\n    // the offset between the cursor's location and the\n    // location of the dragged object.\n    circle.x = event.stageX - offsetX;\n    circle.y = event.stageY - offsetY;\n\n    // Instruct OpenFL to refresh the screen after this event.\n    event.updateAfterEvent ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging);\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\nIn addition to making a display object follow the mouse cursor, it is often desirable to move the dragged object to the front of the display, so that it appears to be floating above all the other objects. For example, suppose you have two objects, a circle and a square, that can both be moved with the mouse. If the circle happens to be below the square on the display list, and you click and drag the circle so that the cursor is over the square, the circle will appear to slide behind the square, which breaks the drag-and-drop illusion. Instead, you can make it so that when the circle is clicked, it moves to the top of the display list, and thus always appears on top of any other content.\nThe following code (adapted from the previous example) allows two display objects, a circle and a square, to be moved with the mouse. Whenever the mouse button is pressed over either one, that item is moved to the top of the Stage’s display list, so that the dragged item always appears on top. \n// This code moves display objects using the mouse-following\n// technique.\n// circle is a DisplayObject (e.g. a MovieClip or Sprite instance).\n\nimport openfl.display.DisplayObject;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\n...\n\nprivate var offsetX:Float;\nprivate var offsetY:Float;\nprivate var draggedObject:DisplayObject;\n\n...\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is pressed.\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // remember which object is being dragged\n    draggedObject = cast (event.target, DisplayObject);\n\n    // Record the difference (offset) between where\n    // the cursor was when the mouse button was pressed and the x, y\n    // coordinate of the circle when the mouse button was pressed.\n    offsetX = event.stageX - circle.x;\n    offsetY = event.stageY - circle.y;\n\n    // move the selected object to the top of the display list \n    stage.addChild (draggedObject);\n\n    // tell OpenFL to start listening for the mouseMove event\n    stage.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is released.\nprivate function stopDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Tell OpenFL to stop listening for the mouseMove event.\n    stage.removeEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called every time the mouse moves,\n// as long as the mouse button is pressed down.\nprivate function dragCircle (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Move the circle to the location of the cursor, maintaining\n    // the offset between the cursor's location and the\n    // location of the dragged object.\n    circle.x = event.stageX - offsetX;\n    circle.y = event.stageY - offsetY;\n\n    // Instruct OpenFL to refresh the screen after this event.\n    event.updateAfterEvent ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging);\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging); \nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\n\nTo extend this effect further, such as for a game where tokens or cards are moved among piles, you could add the dragged object to the Stage’s display list when it’s \"picked up,\" and then add it to another display list—such as the \"pile\" where it is dropped—when the mouse button is released.\nFinally, to enhance the effect, you could apply a drop shadow filter to the display object when it is clicked (when you start dragging it) and remove the drop shadow when the object is released. For details on using the drop shadow filter and other display object filters in Haxe, see Filtering display objects.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/panning-and-scrolling-display-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/panning-and-scrolling-display-objects.html","title":"Panning and scrolling display objects","keywords":"","body":"Panning and scrolling display objects \nIf you have a display object that is too large for the area in which you want it to display it, you can use the scrollRect property to define the viewable area of the display object. In addition, by changing the scrollRect property in response to user input, you can cause the content to pan left and right or scroll up and down.\nThe scrollRect property is an instance of the Rectangle class, which is a class that combines the values needed to define a rectangular area as a single object. To initially define the viewable area of the display object, create a new Rectangle instance and assign it to the display object’s scrollRect property. Later, to scroll or pan, you read the scrollRect property into a separate Rectangle variable, and change the desired property (for instance, change the Rectangle instance’s x property to pan or y property to scroll). Then you reassign that Rectangle instance to the scrollRect property to notify the display object of the changed value.\nFor example, the following code defines the viewable area for a TextField object named bigText that is too tall to fit in the project’s boundaries. When the two buttons named up and down are clicked, they call functions that cause the contents of the TextField object to scroll up or down by modifying the y property of the scrollRect Rectangle instance.\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\n// Define the initial viewable area of the TextField instance:\n// left: 0, top: 0, width: TextField's width, height: 350 pixels.\nbigText.scrollRect = new Rectangle (0, 0, bigText.width, 350);\n\n// Cache the TextField as a bitmap to improve performance.\nbigText.cacheAsBitmap = true;\n\n...\n\n// called when the \"up\" button is clicked\nprivate function scrollUp (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Get access to the current scroll rectangle.\n    var rect = bigText.scrollRect;\n\n    // Decrease the y value of the rectangle by 20, effectively\n    // shifting the rectangle down by 20 pixels.\n    rect.y -= 20;\n\n    // Reassign the rectangle to the TextField to \"apply\" the change.\n    bigText.scrollRect = rect;\n\n}\n\n// called when the \"down\" button is clicked\nprivate function scrollDown (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Get access to the current scroll rectangle.\n    var rect = bigText.scrollRect;\n\n    // Increase the y value of the rectangle by 20, effectively\n    // shifting the rectangle up by 20 pixels.\n    rect.y += 20;\n\n    // Reassign the rectangle to the TextField to \"apply\" the change.\n    bigText.scrollRect = rect;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nup.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, scrollUp);\ndown.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, scrollDown);\n\nAs this example illustrates, when you work with the scrollRect property of a display object, it’s best to specify that OpenFL should cache the display object’s content as a bitmap, using the cacheAsBitmap property. When you do so, OpenFL doesn’t have to re-draw the entire contents of the display object each time it is scrolled, and can instead use the cached bitmap to render the necessary portion directly to the screen. For details, see Caching display objects.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/manipulating-size-and-scaling-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/manipulating-size-and-scaling-objects.html","title":"Manipulating size and scaling objects","keywords":"","body":"Manipulating size and scaling objects \nYou can measure and manipulate the size of a display object in two ways, using either the dimension properties (width and height) or the scale properties (scaleX and scaleY).\nEvery display object has a width property and a height property, which are initially set to the size of the object in pixels. You can read the values of those properties to measure the size of the display object. You can also specify new values to change the size of the object, as follows:\n// Resize a display object.\nsquare.width = 420;\nsquare.height = 420;\n\n// Determine the radius of a circle display object.\nvar radius = circle.width / 2;\n\nChanging the height or width of a display object causes the object to scale, meaning its contents stretch or squeeze to fit in the new area. If the display object contains only vector shapes, those shapes will be redrawn at the new scale, with no loss in quality. Any bitmap graphic elements in the display object will be scaled rather than redrawn. So, for example, a digital photo whose width and height are increased beyond the actual dimensions of the pixel information in the image will be pixelated, making it look jagged.\nWhen you change the width or height properties of a display object, OpenFL updates the scaleX and scaleY properties of the object as well.\nNote: TextField objects are an exception to this scaling behavior. Text fields need to resize themselves to accommodate text wrapping and font sizes, so they reset their scaleX or scaleY values to 1 after resizing. However, if you adjust the scaleX or scaleY values of a TextField object, the width and height values change to accommodate the scaling values you provide.\nThese properties represent the relative size of the display object compared to its original size. The scaleX and scaleY properties use fraction (decimal) values to represent percentage. For example, if a display object’s width has been changed so that it’s half as wide as its original size, the object’s scaleX property will have the value .5, meaning 50 percent. If its height has been doubled, its scaleY property will have the value 2, meaning 200 percent.\n// circle is a display object whose width and height are 150 pixels.\n// At original size, scaleX and scaleY are 1 (100%).\ntrace (circle.scaleX); // output: 1\ntrace (circle.scaleY); // output: 1\n\n// When you change the width and height properties,\n// OpenFL changes the scaleX and scaleY properties accordingly.\ncircle.width = 100;\ncircle.height = 75;\n\ntrace (circle.scaleX); // output: 0.6622516556291391\ntrace (circle.scaleY); // output: 0.4966887417218543\n\nSize changes are not proportional. In other words, if you change the height of a square but not its width, its proportions will no longer be the same, and it will be a rectangle instead of a square. If you want to make relative changes to the size of a display object, you can set the values of the scaleX and scaleY properties to resize the object, as an alternative to setting the width or height properties. For example, this code changes the width of the display object named square, and then alters the vertical scale (scaleY) to match the horizontal scale, so that the size of the square stays proportional.\n// Change the width directly.\nsquare.width = 150;\n\n// Change the vertical scale to match the horizontal scale,\n// to keep the size proportional.\nsquare.scaleY = square.scaleX;\n\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/caching-display-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/caching-display-objects.html","title":"Caching display objects","keywords":"","body":"Caching display objects \nAs your designs in OpenFL grow in size, whether you are creating an application or complex scripted animations, you need to consider performance and optimization. When you have content that remains static (such as a rectangle Shape instance), OpenFL does not optimize the content. Therefore, when you change the position of the rectangle, OpenFL redraws the entire Shape instance.\nYou can cache specified display objects to improve the performance of your project. The display object is a surface, essentially a bitmap version of the instance’s vector data, which is data that you do not intend to change much over the course of your project. Therefore, instances with caching turned on are not continually redrawn as the project plays, letting the project render quickly.\nNote: You can update the vector data, at which time the surface is recreated. Therefore, the vector data cached in the surface does not need to remain the same for the entire project.\nSetting a display object’s cacheAsBitmap property to true makes the display object cache a bitmap representation of itself. OpenFL creates a surface object for the instance, which is a cached bitmap instead of vector data. If you change the bounds of the display object, the surface is recreated instead of resized. Surfaces can nest within other surfaces. The child surface copies its bitmap onto its parent surface. For more information, see Enabling bitmap caching.\nThe DisplayObject class’s opaqueBackground property and scrollRect property are related to bitmap caching using the cacheAsBitmap property. Although these three properties are independent of each other, the opaqueBackground and scrollRect properties work best when an object is cached as a bitmap—you see performance benefits for the opaqueBackground and scrollRect properties only when you set cacheAsBitmap to true. For more information about scrolling display object content, see Panning and scrolling display objects. For more information about setting an opaque background, see Setting an opaque background color.\nFor information on alpha channel masking, which requires you to set the cacheAsBitmap property to true, see Masking display objects.\nWhen to enable caching \nEnabling caching for a display object creates a surface, which has several advantages, such as helping complex vector animations to render fast. There are several scenarios in which you will want to enable caching. It might seem as though you would always want to enable caching to improve the performance of your projects; however, there are situations in which enabling caching does not improve performance, or can even decrease it. This section describes scenarios in which caching should be used, and when to use regular display objects.\nOverall performance of cached data depends on how complex the vector data of your instances are, how much of the data you change, and whether or not you set the opaqueBackground property. If you are changing small regions, the difference between using a surface and using vector data could be negligible. You might want to test both scenarios with your work before you deploy the application.\nWhen to use bitmap caching\nThe following are typical scenarios in which you might see significant benefits when you enable bitmap caching.\n\nComplex background image: An application that contains a detailed and complex background image of vector data (perhaps an image where you applied the trace bitmap command, or artwork that you created in Adobe Illustrator®). You might animate characters over the background, which slows the animation because the background needs to continuously regenerate the vector data. To improve performance, you can set the opaqueBackground property of the background display object to true. The background is rendered as a bitmap and can be redrawn quickly, so that your animation plays much faster.\nScrolling text field: An application that displays a large amount of text in a scrolling text field. You can place the text field in a display object that you set as scrollable with scrolling bounds (the scrollRect property). This enables fast pixel scrolling for the specified instance. When a user scrolls the display object instance, OpenFL shifts the scrolled pixels up and generates the newly exposed region instead of regenerating the entire text field.\nWindowing system: An application with a complex system of overlapping windows. Each window can be open or closed (for example, web browser windows). If you mark each window as a surface (by setting the cacheAsBitmap property to true), each window is isolated and cached. Users can drag the windows so that they overlap each other, and each window doesn’t need to regenerate the vector content.\nAlpha channel masking: When you are using alpha channel masking, you must set the cacheAsBitmap property to true. For more information, see Masking display objects.\n\nEnabling bitmap caching in all of these scenarios improves the responsiveness and interactivity of the application by optimizing the vector graphics.\nIn addition, whenever you apply a filter to a display object, cacheAsBitmap is automatically set to true, even if you explicitly set it to false. If you clear all the filters from the display object, the cacheAsBitmap property returns to the value it was last set to.\nWhen to avoid using bitmap caching\nUsing this feature in the wrong circumstances can negatively affect the performance of your project. When you use bitmap caching, remember the following guidelines:\n\nDo not overuse surfaces (display objects with caching enabled). Each surface uses more memory than a regular display object, which means that you should only enable surfaces when you need to improve rendering performance.\n\nA cached bitmap can use significantly more memory than a regular display object. For example, if a Sprite instance on the Stage is 250 pixels by 250 pixels in size, when cached it might use 250 KB instead of 1 KB when it’s a regular (un-cached) Sprite instance.\n\nAvoid zooming into cached surfaces. If you overuse bitmap caching, a large amount of memory is consumed (see previous bullet), especially if you zoom in on the content.\nUse surfaces for display object instances that are largely static (non-animating). You can drag or move the instance, but the contents of the instance should not animate or change a lot. (Animation or changing content are more likely with a MovieClip instance containing animation or a Video instance.) For example, if you rotate or transform an instance, the instance changes between the surface and vector data, which is difficult to process and negatively affects your project.\nIf you mix surfaces with vector data, it increases the amount of processing that OpenFL (and sometimes the computer) need to do. Group surfaces together as much as possible—for example, when you create windowing applications.\nDo not cache objects whose graphics change frequently. Every time you scale, skew, rotate the display object, change the alpha or color transform, move child display objects, or draw using the graphics property, the bitmap cache is redrawn. If this happens every frame, the runtime must draw the object into a bitmap and then copy that bitmap onto the stage—which results in extra work compared to just drawing the uncached object to the stage. The performance tradeoff of caching versus update frequency depends on the complexity and size of the display object and can only be determined by testing the specific content.\n\nEnabling bitmap caching \nTo enable bitmap caching for a display object, you set its cacheAsBitmap property to true: mySprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nAfter you set the cacheAsBitmap property to true, you might notice that the display object automatically pixel-snaps to whole coordinates. When you test the project, you should notice that any animation performed on a complex vector image renders much faster.\nA surface (cached bitmap) is not created, even if cacheAsBitmap is set to true, if one or more of the following occurs:\n\nThe bitmap is greater than 2880 pixels in height or width.\nThe bitmap fails to allocate (because of an out-of-memory error).\n\n\nSetting an opaque background color \nYou can set an opaque background for a display object. For example, when your project has a background that contains complex vector art, you can set the opaqueBackground property to a specified color (typically the same color as the Stage). The color is specified as a number (commonly a hexadecimal color value). The background is then treated as a bitmap, which helps optimize performance.\nWhen you set cacheAsBitmap to true, and also set the opaqueBackground property to a specified color, the opaqueBackground property allows the internal bitmap to be opaque and rendered faster. If you do not set cacheAsBitmap to true, the opaqueBackground property adds an opaque vector-square shape to the background of the display object. It does not create a bitmap automatically.\nThe following example shows how to set the background of a display object to optimize performance:\nmyShape.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nmyShape.opaqueBackground = 0xFF0000;\n\nIn this case, the background color of the Shape named myShape is set to red (0xFF0000). Assuming the Shape instance contains a drawing of a green triangle, on a Stage with a white background, this would show up as a green triangle with red in the empty space in the Shape instance’s bounding box (the rectangle that completely encloses the Shape).\n\nOf course, this code would make more sense if it were used with a Stage with a solid red background. On another colored background, that color would be specified instead. For example, in a project with a white background, the opaqueBackground property would most likely be set to 0xFFFFFF, or pure white.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/setting-an-opaque-background.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/setting-an-opaque-background.html","title":"Setting an opaque background color","keywords":"","body":"Setting an opaque background color \nYou can set an opaque background for a display object.

Each display object has a transform property, which is an instance of the Transform class, and contains information about various transformations that are applied to the display object (such as rotation, changes in scale or position, and so forth). In addition to its information about geometric transformations, the Transform class also includes a colorTransform property, which is an instance of the ColorTransform class, and provides access to make color adjustments to the display object. To access the color transformation information of a display object, you can use code such as this:\nvar colorInfo = myDisplayObject.transform.colorTransform;\n\nOnce you’ve created a ColorTransform instance, you can read its property values to find out what color transformations have already been applied, or you can set those values to make color changes to the display object. To update the display object after any changes, you must reassign the ColorTransform instance back to the transform.colorTransform property.\nvar colorInfo = myDisplayObject.transform.colorTransform;\n\n// Make some color transformations here.\n// Commit the change.\nmyDisplayObject.transform.colorTransform = colorInfo;\n\nSetting color values with code\nThe color property of the ColorTransform class can be used to assign a specific red, green, blue (RGB) color value to the display object. The following example uses the color property to change the color of the display object named square to blue, when the user clicks a button named blueBtn:\n// square is a display object on the Stage.\n// blueBtn, redBtn, greenBtn, and blackBtn are buttons on the Stage.\n\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.geom.ColorTransform;\n\n// Get access to the ColorTransform instance associated with square.\nvar colorInfo = square.transform.colorTransform;\n\n// This function is called when blueBtn is clicked.\nprivate function makeBlue (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Set the color of the ColorTransform object.\n    colorInfo.color = 0x003399;\n\n    // apply the change to the display object square.\n    transform.colorTransform = colorInfo;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nblueBtn.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, makeBlue);\n\nNote that when you change a display object’s color using the color property, it completely changes the color of the entire object, regardless of whether the object previously had multiple colors. For example, if there is a display object containing a green circle with black text on top, setting the color property of that object’s associated ColorTransform instance to a shade of red will make the entire object, circle and text, turn red (so the text will no longer be distinguishable from the rest of the object).\nAltering color and brightness effects with code\nSuppose you have a display object with multiple colors (for example, a digital photo) and you don’t want to completely recolor the object; you just want to adjust the color of a display object based on the existing colors. In this scenario, the ColorTransform class includes a series of multiplier and offset properties that you can use to make this type of adjustment. The multiplier properties, named redMultiplier, greenMultiplier, blueMultiplier, and alphaMultiplier, work like colored photographic filters (or colored sunglasses), amplifying or diminishing certain colors in the display object. The offset properties (redOffset, greenOffset, blueOffset, and alphaOffset) can be used to add extra amounts of a certain color to the object, or to specify the minimum value that a particular color can have.\nThese multiplier and offset properties are identical to the advanced color settings that are available for movie clip symbols in the Flash authoring tool when you choose Advanced from the Color pop-up menu on the Property inspector.\nThe following code loads a JPEG image and applies a color transformation to it, which adjusts the red and green channels as the mouse pointer moves along the x axis and y axis. In this case, because no offset values are specified, the color value of each color channel displayed on screen will be a percentage of the original color value in the image—meaning that the most red or green displayed in any given pixel will be the original amount of red or green in that pixel.\nimport openfl.display.Loader;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.geom.Transform;\nimport openfl.geom.ColorTransform;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\n...\n\n// Load an image onto the Stage.\nvar loader = new Loader ();\nvar url = new URLRequest (\"http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/images/image1.jpg\");\nloader.load (url);\nthis.addChild (loader);\n\n...\n\n// This function is called when the mouse moves over the loaded image.\nprivate function adjustColor (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Access the ColorTransform object for the Loader (containing the image)\n    var colorTransformer = loader.transform.colorTransform;\n\n    // Set the red and green multipliers according to the mouse position.\n    // The red value ranges from 0% (no red) when the cursor is at the left\n    // to 100% red (normal image appearance) when the cursor is at the right.\n    // The same applies to the green channel, except it's controlled by the\n    // position of the mouse in the y axis.\n    colorTransformer.redMultiplier = (loader.mouseX / loader.width) * 1;\n    colorTransformer.greenMultiplier = (loader.mouseY / loader.height) * 1;\n\n    // Apply the changes to the display object.\n    loader.transform.colorTransform = colorTransformer;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nloader.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, adjustColor);\n\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/rotating-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/rotating-objects.html","title":"Rotating objects","keywords":"","body":"Rotating objects \nDisplay objects can be rotated using the rotation property.

For example, these lines of code make the object named myBall partially (50 percent) transparent when it is clicked with the mouse:\nprivate function fadeBall (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    myBall.alpha = .5;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nmyBall.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, fadeBall);\n\nYou can also alter the transparency of a display object using the color adjustments available through the ColorTransform class.

For instance, the following code creates a Shape instance containing a red 100 by 100 pixel square and a Sprite instance containing a blue circle with a radius of 25 pixels. When the circle is clicked, it is set as the mask for the square, so that the only part of the square that shows is the part that is covered by the solid part of the circle. In other words, only a red circle will be visible.\n// This code assumes it's being run within a display object container\n// such as a MovieClip or Sprite instance.\n\nimport openfl.display.Shape;\n\n...\n\n// Draw a square and add it to the display list.\nvar square = new Shape ();\nsquare.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0xff0000);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\nsquare.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (square);\n\n// Draw a circle and add it to the display list.\nvar circle = new Sprite ();\ncircle.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\ncircle.graphics.beginFill (0x0000ff);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle (25, 25, 25);\ncircle.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (circle);\n\n...\n\nprivate function maskSquare (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.mask = circle;\n    circle.removeEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, maskSquare);\n\n}\n\n...\n\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, maskSquare);\n\nThe display object that is acting as a mask can be draggable, animated, resized dynamically, and can use separate shapes within a single mask. The mask display object doesn’t necessarily need to be added to the display list. However, if you want the mask object to scale when the Stage is scaled or if you want to enable user interaction with the mask (such as user-controlled dragging and resizing), the mask object must be added to the display list. The actual z-index (front-to-back order) of the display objects doesn’t matter, as long as the mask object is added to the display list. (The mask object will not appear on the screen except as a mask.) If the mask object is a MovieClip instance with multiple frames, it plays all the frames in its timeline, the same as it would if it were not serving as a mask. You can remove a mask by setting the mask property to null:\n// remove the mask from mySprite\nmySprite.mask = null;\n\nYou cannot use a mask to mask another mask. You cannot set the alpha property of a mask display object. Only fills are used in a display object that is used as a mask; strokes are ignored.\n\nAbout masking device fonts\nYou can use a display object to mask text that is set in a device font. When you use a display object to mask text set in a device font, the rectangular bounding box of the mask is used as the masking shape. That is, if you create a non-rectangular display object mask for device font text, the mask that appears in the project is the shape of the rectangular bounding box of the mask, not the shape of the mask itself.\nAlpha channel masking\nAlpha channel masking is supported if both the mask and the masked display objects use bitmap caching, as shown here:\n// maskShape is a Shape instance which includes a gradient fill.\nmySprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nmaskShape.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nmySprite.mask = maskShape;\n\nFor instance, one application of alpha channel masking is to use a filter on the mask object independently of a filter that is applied to the masked display object.\nIn the following example, an external image file is loaded onto the Stage. That image (or more accurately, the Loader instance it is loaded into) will be the display object that is masked. A gradient oval (solid black center fading to transparent at the edges) is drawn over the image; this will be the alpha mask. Both display objects have bitmap caching turned on. The oval is set as a mask for the image, and it is then made draggable.\n// This code assumes it's being run within a display object container\n// such as a MovieClip or Sprite instance.\n\nimport openfl.display.GradientType;\nimport openfl.display.Loader;\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.geom.Matrix;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\n...\n\n// Load an image and add it to the display list.\nvar loader = new Loader ();\nvar url = new URLRequest (\"http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/images/image1.jpg\");\nloader.load (url);\nthis.addChild (loader);\n\n// Create a Sprite.\nvar oval = new Sprite ();\n\n// Draw a gradient oval.\nvar colors = [0x000000, 0x000000];\nvar alphas = [1, 0];\nvar ratios = [0, 255];\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nmatrix.createGradientBox (200, 100, 0, -100, -50);\noval.graphics.beginGradientFill (GradientType.RADIAL, colors, alphas, ratios, matrix);\noval.graphics.drawEllipse (-100, -50, 200, 100);\noval.graphics.endFill ();\n\n// add the Sprite to the display list\nthis.addChild (oval);\n\n// Set cacheAsBitmap = true for both display objects.\nloader.cacheAsBitmap = true;\noval.cacheAsBitmap = true;\n\n// Set the oval as the mask for the loader (and its child, the loaded image)\nloader.mask = oval;\n\n// Make the oval draggable.\noval.startDrag (true);\n\n"},"display-programming/animating-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/animating-objects.html","title":"Animating objects","keywords":"","body":"Animating objects \nAnimation is the process of making something move, or alternatively, of making something change over time. Scripted animation is a fundamental part of video games, and is often used to add polish and useful interaction clues to other applications.\nThe fundamental idea behind scripted animation is that a change needs to take place, and that change needs to be divided into increments over time. It’s easy to make something repeat in Haxe, using a common looping statement. However, a loop will run through all its iterations before updating the display. To create scripted animation, you need to write Haxe that performs some action repeatedly over time and also updates the screen each time it runs.\nFor example, imagine you want to create a simple animation, such as making a ball travel across the screen. Haxe includes a simple mechanism that allows you to track the passage of time and update the screen accordingly—meaning you could write code that moves the ball a small amount each time, until it reaches its destination. After each move the screen would update, making the cross-Stage motion visible to the viewer.\nFrom a practical standpoint, it makes sense to synchronize scripted animation with the project’s frame rate (in other words, make one animation change each time a new frame displays or would display), since that defines how frequently OpenFL updates the screen. Each display object has an enterFrame event that is dispatched according to the frame rate of the project—one event per frame. Most developers who create scripted animation use the enterFrame event as a way to create actions that repeat over time. You could write code that listens to the enterFrame event, moving the animated ball a certain amount each frame, and as the screen is updated (each frame), the ball would be redrawn in its new location, creating motion.\nNote: Another way to perform an action repeatedly over time is to use the Timer class. A Timer instance triggers an event notification each time a specified amount of time has past. You could write code that performs animation by handling the Timer class’s timer event, setting the time interval to a small one (some fraction of a second). For more information about using the Timer class, see\n\"Controlling time intervals\" on page 4\n.\nIn the following example, a circle Sprite instance, named circle, is created on the Stage. When the user clicks the circle, a scripted animation sequence begins, causing circle to fade (its alpha property is decreased) until it is completely transparent:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n// draw a circle and add it to the display list\nvar circle:Sprite = new Sprite();\ncircle.graphics.beginFill(0x990000);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle(50, 50, 50);\ncircle.graphics.endFill();\naddChild(circle);\n// When this animation starts, this function is called every frame.\n// The change made by this function (updated to the screen every\n// frame) is what causes the animation to occur.\nfunction fadeCircle(event:Event):void\n{\ncircle.alpha -= .05;\nif (circle.alpha \n{\ncircle.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, fadeCircle);\n}\n}\nfunction startAnimation(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\ncircle.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, fadeCircle);\n}\ncircle.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, startAnimation);\nWhen the user clicks the circle, the function fadeCircle() is subscribed as a listener of the enterFrame event, meaning it begins to be called once per frame. That function fades circle by changing its alpha property, so once per frame the circle’s alpha decreases by .05 (5 percent) and the screen is updated. Eventually, when the alpha value is 0 (circle is completely transparent), the fadeCircle() function is removed as an event listener, ending the animation.\nThe same code could be used, for example, to create animated motion instead of fading. By substituting a different property for alpha in the function that is an enterFrame event listener, that property will be animated instead. For example, changing this line\ncircle.alpha -= .05;\nto this code\ncircle.x += 5;\nwill animate the x property, causing the circle to move to the right across the Stage. The condition that ends the animation could be changed to end the animation (that is, unsubscribe the enterFrame listener) when the desired x coordinate is reached.\n"},"display-programming/loading-display-content-dynamically/":{"url":"display-programming/loading-display-content-dynamically/","title":"Loading display content dynamically","keywords":"","body":"Loading display content dynamically \nYou can load any of the following external display assets into an OpenFL application:\n\nA project authored in Haxe—This file can be a Sprite, MovieClip, or any class that extends Sprite.\nAn image file—This includes JPG, PNG, and GIF files.\nAn AVM1 project—This is a project written in Haxe 1.0 or 2.0.

A Loader object can contain only one child display object in its display list—the display object representing the asset library or graphic file that it loads.

A LoaderInfo object provides information such as load progress, the URLs of the loader and loadee, the number of bytes total for the media, and the nominal height and width of the media. A LoaderInfo object also dispatches events for monitoring the progress of the load.\nThe following diagram shows the different uses of the LoaderInfo object—for the instance of the main class of the project, for a Loader object, and for an object loaded by the Loader object:\n\nThe LoaderInfo object can be accessed as a property of both the Loader object and the loaded display object. As soon as loading begins, the LoaderInfo object can be accessed through the contentLoaderInfo property of the Loader object. Once the display object has finished loading, the LoaderInfo object can also be accessed as a property of the loaded display object through the display object’s loaderInfo property.

This parameter is a LoaderContext object.\nThe LoaderContext class includes three properties that let you define the context of how the loaded content can be used:\n\ncheckPolicyFile: Use this property only when loading an image file (not a SWF asset). If you set this property to true, the Loader checks the origin server for a policy file (see Website controls (policy files)). This is necessary only for content originating from domains other than that of the project containing the Loader object. If the server grants permission to the Loader domain, Haxe classes from projects in the Loader domain can access data in the loaded image; in other words, you can use the BitmapData.draw() command to access data in the loaded image.\n\nNote that a project from other domains than that of the Loader object can call Security.allowDomain() to permit a specific domain.\n\nsecurityDomain: Use this property only when loading a project (not an image). Specify this for a project from a domain other than that of the file containing the Loader object. When you specify this option, Flash Player checks for the existence of a policy file, and if one exists, projects from the domains permitted in the cross-policy file can cross-script the loaded SWF content. You can specify openfl.system.SecurityDomain.currentDomain as this parameter.\napplicationDomain: Use this property only when loading a SWF file written in Haxe or ActionScript 3.0 (not an image or a SWF file written in ActionScript 1.0 or 2.0). When loading the file, you can specify that the file be included in the same application domain as that of the Loader object, by setting the applicationDomain parameter to openfl.system.ApplicationDomain.currentDomain. By putting the loaded project in the same application domain, you can access its classes directly. This can be useful if you are loading a project that contains embedded media, which you can access via their associated class names. For more information, see Working with application domains.\n\nHere’s an example of checking for a policy file when loading a bitmap from another domain:\nvar context = new LoaderContext ();\ncontext.checkPolicyFile = true;\nvar urlReq = new URLRequest (\"http://www.[your_domain_here].com/photo11.jpg\");\nvar ldr = new Loader ();\nldr.load (urlReq, context);\n\nHere’s an example of checking for a policy file when loading a SWF from another domain, in order to place the file in the same security sandbox as the Loader object.

These classes don’t necessarily provide functionality by themselves; however, they are used to define the properties of objects that are used in other classes.\nAll the geometry classes are based around the notion that locations on the screen are represented as a two-dimensional plane. The screen is treated like a flat graph with a horizontal (x) axis and a vertical (y) axis. Any location (or point) on the screen can be represented as a pair of x and y values—the coordinates of that location.\nEvery display object, including the Stage, has its own coordinate space. The coordinate space is an object’s own graph for plotting the locations of child display objects, drawings, and so on. The origin is at coordinate location 0, 0 (where the x and y-axes meet), and is placed at the upper-left corner of the display object. While this origin location is always true for the Stage, it is not necessarily true for other display objects. Values on the x-axis get bigger going toward the right, and smaller going toward the left. For locations to the left of the origin, the x coordinate is negative. However, contrary to traditional coordinate systems, OpenFL coordinate values on the y-axis get bigger going down the screen and smaller going up the screen. Values above the origin have a negative y coordinate value). Since the upper-left corner of the Stage is the origin of its coordinate space, most objects on the Stage have an x coordinate greater than 0 and smaller than the Stage width. And the same object has a y coordinate larger than 0 and smaller than the Stage height.\nYou can use Point class instances to represent individual points in a coordinate space. You can create a Rectangle instance to represent a rectangular region in a coordinate space. For advanced users, you can use a Matrix instance to apply multiple or complex transformations to a display object. Many simple transformations, such as rotation, position, and scale changes, can be applied directly to a display object using that object’s properties. For more information on applying transformations using display object properties, see Manipulating display objects.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important geometry terms:\nCartesian coordinates Coordinates are commonly written as a pair of number (like 5, 12 or 17, -23). The two numbers are the x coordinate and the y coordinate, respectively.\nCoordinate space The graph of coordinates contained in a display object, on which its child elements are positioned.\nOrigin The point in a coordinate space where the x-axis meets the y-axis.

The rectangle is resized accordingly:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.right = 60;\nrect1.bottom = 20;\ntrace (rect1); // (x=0, y=0, w=60, h=20)\n\nYou can also reposition a Rectangle object by using the offset() method, as follows:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.offset (20, 30);\ntrace(rect1); // (x=20, y=30, w=100, h=50)\n\nThe offsetPt() method works similarly, except that it takes a Point object as its parameter, rather than x and y offset values.\nYou can also resize a Rectangle object by using the inflate() method, which includes two parameters, dx and dy. The dx parameter represents the number of pixels that the left and right sides of the rectangle moves from the center. The dy parameter represents the number of pixels that the top and bottom of the rectangle moves from the center:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.inflate (6, 4);\ntrace (rect1); // (x=-6, y=-4, w=112, h=58)\n\nThe inflatePt() method works similarly, except that it takes a Point object as its parameter, rather than dx and dy values.\nFinding unions and intersections of Rectangle objects \nYou use the union() method to find the rectangular region formed by the boundaries of two rectangles:\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect1); // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=100)\n\nvar rect2 = new Rectangle (120, 60, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect2); // (x=120, y=60, w=100, h=100)\ntrace (rect1.union (rect2)); // (x=0, y=0, w=220, h=160)\n\nYou use the intersection() method to find the rectangular region formed by the overlapping region of two rectangles:\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect1); // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=100)\n\nvar rect2 = new Rectangle (80, 60, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect2); // (x=120, y=60, w=100, h=100)\ntrace (rect1.intersection (rect2)); // (x=80, y=60, w=20, h=40)\n\nYou use the intersects() method to find out whether two rectangles intersect. You can also use the intersects() method to find out whether a display object is in a certain region of the Stage. For the following code example, assume the coordinate space of the display object container that contains the circle object is the same as that of the Stage. The example shows how to use the intersects() method to determine if a display object, circle, intersects specified regions of the Stage, defined by the target1 and target2 Rectangle objects:\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar circle = new Shape ();\ncircle.graphics.lineStyle (2, 0xFF0000);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle (250, 250, 100);\naddChild (circle);\n\nvar circleBounds = circle.getBounds (stage);\nvar target1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\ntrace (circleBounds.intersects (target1)); // false\n\nvar target2 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 300, 300);\ntrace (circleBounds.intersects (target2)); // true\n\nSimilarly, you can use the intersects() method to find out whether the bounding rectangles of two display objects overlap. Use the getRect() method of the DisplayObject class to include any additional space that the strokes of a display object add to a bounding region.\nOther uses of Rectangle objects \nRectangle objects are used in the following methods and properties:\n\n\n\nClass\nMethods or properties\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBitmapData\napplyFilter()colorTransform()copyChannel()copyPixels()draw()drawWithQuality()encode()fillRect()generateFilterRect()getColorBoundsRect()getPixels()merge()paletteMap()pixelDissolve()setPixels()threshold()\nUsed as the type for some parameters to define a region of the BitmapData object.\n\n\nDisplayObject\ngetBounds()getRect()scrollRectscale9Grid\nUsed as the data type for the property or the data type returned.\n\n\nPrintJob\naddPage()\nUsed to define the printArea parameter.\n\n\nSprite\nstartDrag()\nUsed to define the bounds parameter.\n\n\nTextField\ngetCharBoundaries()\nUsed as the return value type.\n\n\nTransform\npixelBounds\nUsed as the data type.\n\n\n\n"},"working-with-geometry/using-matrix-objects.html":{"url":"working-with-geometry/using-matrix-objects.html","title":"Using Matrix objects","keywords":"","body":"Using Matrix objects \nThe Matrix class represents a transformation matrix that determines how to map points from one coordinate space to another. You can perform various graphical transformations on a display object by setting the properties of a Matrix object, applying that Matrix object to the matrix property of a Transform object, and then applying that Transform object as the transform property of the display object. These transformation functions include translation (x and y repositioning), rotation, scaling, and skewing.\nAlthough you could define a matrix by directly adjusting the properties (a, b, c, d, tx, ty) of a Matrix object, it is easier to use the createBox() method. This method includes parameters that let you directly define the scaling, rotation, and translation effects of the resulting matrix. For example, the following code creates a Matrix object that scales an object horizontally by 2.0, scales it vertically by 3.0, rotates it by 45°, moving (translating) it 10 pixels to the right, and moving it 20 pixels down:\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nvar scaleX = 2.0;\nvar scaleY = 3.0;\nvar rotation = 2 * Math.PI * (45 / 360);\nvar tx = 10;\nvar ty = 20;\nmatrix.createBox (scaleX, scaleY, rotation, tx, ty);\n\nYou can also adjust the scaling, rotation, and translation effects of a Matrix object by using the scale(), rotate(), and translate() methods. Note that these methods combine with the values of the existing Matrix object. For example, the following code sets a Matrix object that scales an object by a factor of 4 and rotates it 60°, since the scale() and rotate() methods are called twice:\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nvar rotation = 2 * Math.PI * (30 / 360); // 30°\nvar scaleFactor = 2;\nmatrix.scale (scaleFactor, scaleFactor);\nmatrix.rotate (rotation);\nmatrix.scale (scaleX, scaleY);\nmatrix.rotate (rotation);\n\nmyDisplayObject.transform.matrix = matrix;\n\nTo apply a skew transformation to a Matrix object, adjust its b or c property. Adjusting the b property skews the matrix vertically, and adjusting the c property skews the matrix horizontally. The following code skews the myMatrix Matrix object vertically by a factor of 2:\nvar skewMatrix = new Matrix ();\nskewMatrix.b = Math.tan (2);\nmyMatrix.concat (skewMatrix);\n\nYou can apply a Matrix transformation to the transform property of a display object. For example, the following code applies a matrix transformation to a display object named myDisplayObject:\nvar matrix = myDisplayObject.transform.matrix;\nvar scaleFactor = 2;\nvar rotation = 2 * Math.PI * (60 / 360); // 60°\nmatrix.scale (scaleFactor, scaleFactor);\nmatrix.rotate (rotation);\n\nmyDisplayObject.transform.matrix = matrix;\n\nThe first line sets a Matrix object to the existing transformation matrix used by the myDisplayObject display object (the matrix property of the transformation property of the myDisplayObject display object). This way, the Matrix class methods that you call have a cumulative effect on the display object’s existing position, scale, and rotation.\nNote: The ColorTransform class is also included in the openfl.geom package. This class is used to set the colorTransform property of a Transform object. Since it does not apply any geometrical transformation, it is not discussed, in detail, here.

The openfl.display.Graphics class provides this functionality. You can draw with Haxe code on any Shape, Sprite, or MovieClip instance, using the graphics property defined in each of those classes. (Each of those classes’ graphics property is in fact an instance of the Graphics class.)\nIf you’re just getting started with drawing with code, the Graphics class includes several methods that make it easy to draw common shapes like circles, ellipses, rectangles, and rectangles with rounded corners. You can draw them as empty lines or filled shapes. When you need more advanced functionality, the Graphics class also includes methods for drawing lines and quadratic Bézier curves, which you can use in conjunction with the trigonometry functions in the Math class to create any shape you need.\nOpenFL adds an additional API for drawing, which allow you to programmatically draw entire shapes with a single command. Once you’re familiar with the Graphics class and tasks covered in Basics of using the drawing API, continue to Advanced use of the drawing API to learn more about these drawing API features.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter while using the drawing API:\nAnchor point One of the two end points of a quadratic Bézier curve.\nControl point The point that defines the direction and amount of curve of a quadratic Bézier curve. The curved line never reaches the control point; however, the line curves as though being drawn toward the control point.\nCoordinate space The graph of coordinates contained in a display object, on which its child elements are positioned.\nFill The solid inner portion of a shape that has a line filled in with color, or all of a shape that has no outline.\nGradient A color that consists of a gradual transition from one color to one or more other colors (as opposed to a solid color).\nPoint A single location in a coordinate space. In the 2-d coordinate system used in Haxe, a point is defined by its location along the x axis and the y axis (the point’s coordinates).\nQuadratic Bézier curve A type of curve defined by a particular mathematical formula. In this type of curve, the shape of the curve is calculated based on the positions of the anchor points (the end points of the curve) and a control point that defines the amount and direction of the curve.\nScale The size of an object relative to its original size. When used as a verb, to scale an object means to change its size by stretching or shrinking the object.\nStroke The outline portion of a shape that has a line filled in with color, or the lines of an un-filled shape.\nTranslate To change a point’s coordinates from one coordinate space to another.\nX axis The horizontal axis in the 2-d coordinate system used in Haxe.\nY axis The vertical axis in the 2-d coordinate system used in Haxe.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/understanding-the-graphics-class.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/understanding-the-graphics-class.html","title":"Understanding the Graphics class","keywords":"","body":"Understanding The Graphics class \nEach Shape, Sprite, and MovieClip object has a graphics property, which is an instance of the Graphics class. The Graphics class includes properties and methods for drawing lines, fills, and shapes. If you want a display object to use solely as a canvas for drawing content, you can use a Shape instance. A Shape instance will perform better than other display objects for drawing, because it doesn’t have the overhead of the additional functionality in the Sprite and MovieClip classes. If you want a display object on which you can draw graphical content and also want that object to contain other display objects, you can use a Sprite instance. For more information on determining which display object to use for various tasks, see Choosing a DisplayObject subclass.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/drawing-lines-and-curves.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/drawing-lines-and-curves.html","title":"Drawing lines and curves","keywords":"","body":"Drawing lines and curves \nAll drawing that you do with a Graphics instance is based on basic drawing with lines and curves. Consequently, all Haxe-based drawing must be performed using the same series of steps:\n\nDefine line and fill styles\nSet the initial drawing position\nDraw lines, curves, and shapes (optionally moving the drawing point)\nIf necessary, finish creating a fill\n\nDefining line and fill styles\nTo draw with the graphics property of a Shape, Sprite, or MovieClip instance, you must first define the style (line size and color, fill color) to use when drawing. Just like when you use the drawing tools in Adobe® Flash® Professional or another drawing application, when you’re using Haxe code to draw you can draw with or without a stroke, and with or without a fill color. You specify the appearance of the stroke using the lineStyle() or lineGradientStyle() method. To create a solid line, use the lineStyle() method. When calling this method, the most common values you’ll specify are the first three parameters: lineThickness, color, and alpha. For example, this line of code tells the Shape named myShape to draw lines that are 2 pixels thick, red (0x990000), and 75% opaque:\nmyShape.graphics.lineStyle (2, 0x990000, .75);\n\nThe default value for the alpha parameter is 1.0 (100%), so you can leave that parameter off if you want a completely opaque line. The lineStyle() method also accepts two additional parameters for pixel hinting and scale mode; for more information about using those parameters see the description of the Graphics.lineStyle() method in the API Reference.\nTo create a gradient line, use the lineGradientStyle() method. This method is described in Creating gradient lines and fills.\nIf you want to create a filled shape, you call the beginFill(), beginGradientFill(), beginBitmapFill(), or beginShaderFill() methods before starting the drawing. The most basic of these, the beginFill() method, accepts two parameters: the fill color, and (optionally) an alpha value for the fill color. For example, if you want to draw a shape with a solid green fill, you would use the following code (assuming you’re drawing on an object named myShape):\nmyShape.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00);\n\nCalling any fill method implicitly ends any previous fill before starting a new one. Calling any method that specifies a stroke style replaces the previous stroke, but does not alter a previously specified fill, and vice versa.\nOnce you have specified the line style and fill properties, the next step is to indicate the starting point for your drawing. The Graphics instance has a drawing point, like the tip of a pen on a piece of paper. Wherever the drawing point is located, that is where the next drawing action will begin. Initially a Graphics object begins with its drawing point at the point 0, 0 in the coordinate space of the object on which it’s drawing. To start the drawing at a different point, you can first call the moveTo() method before calling one of the drawing methods. This is analogous to lifting the pen tip off of the paper and moving it to a new position.\nWith the drawing point in place you draw using a series of calls to the drawing methods lineTo() (for drawing straight lines) and curveTo() (for drawing curved lines).\nWhile you are drawing, you can call the moveTo() method at any time to move the drawing point to a new position without drawing.\nWhile drawing, if you have specified a fill color, you can close off the fill by calling the endFill() method. If you have not drawn a closed shape (in other words, if at the time you call endFill() the drawing point is not at the starting point of the shape), when you call the endFill() method OpenFL automatically closes the shape by drawing a straight line from the current drawing point to the location specified in the most recent moveTo() call. If you have started a fill and not called endFill(), calling beginFill() (or one of the other fill methods) closes the current fill and starts the new one.\nDrawing straight lines \nWhen you call the lineTo() method, the Graphics object draws a straight line from the current drawing point to the coordinates you specify as the two parameters in the method call, drawing with the line style you have specified. For example, this line of code puts the drawing point at the point 100, 100 then draws a line to the point 200, 200:\nmyShape.graphics.moveTo (100, 100);\nmyShape.graphics.lineTo (200, 200);\n\nThe following example draws red and green triangles with a height of 100 pixels:\nvar triangleHeight = 100;\nvar triangle = new Shape ();\n\n// red triangle, starting at point 0, 0\ntriangle.graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\ntriangle.graphics.moveTo (triangleHeight / 2, 0);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (triangleHeight, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (0, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (triangleHeight / 2, 0);\n\n// green triangle, starting at point 200, 0\ntriangle.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00);\ntriangle.graphics.moveTo (200 + triangleHeight / 2, 0);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (200 + triangleHeight, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (200, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (200 + triangleHeight / 2, 0);\nthis.addChild (triangle);\n\nDrawing curves \nThe curveTo() method draws a quadratic Bézier curve. This draws an arc that connects two points (called anchor points) while bending toward a third point (called the control point). The Graphics object uses the current drawing position as the first anchor point. When you call the curveTo() method, you pass four parameters: the x and y coordinates of the control point, followed by the x and y coordinates of the second anchor point. For example, the following code draws a curve starting at point 100, 100 and ending at point 200, 200. Because the control point is at point 175, 125, this creates a curve that moves to the right and then downward:\nmyShape.graphics.moveTo (100, 100);\nmyShape.graphics.curveTo (175, 125, 200, 200);\n\nThe following example draws red and green circular objects with a width and height of 100 pixels. Note that due to the nature of the quadratic Bézier equation, these are not perfect circles:\nvar size = 100;\nvar roundObject = new Shape ();\n\n// red circular shape\nroundObject.graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\nroundObject.graphics.moveTo (size / 2, 0);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (size, 0, size, size / 2);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (size, size, size / 2, size);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (0, size, 0, size / 2);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (0, 0, size / 2, 0);\n\n// green circular shape\nroundObject.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00);\nroundObject.graphics.moveTo (200 + size / 2, 0);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (200 + size, 0, 200 + size, size / 2); roundObject.graphics.curveTo (200 + size, size, 200 + size / 2, size); roundObject.graphics.curveTo (200, size, 200, size / 2);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (200, 0, 200 + size / 2, 0); \nthis.addChild (roundObject);\n\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/drawing-shapes-using-built-in-methods.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/drawing-shapes-using-built-in-methods.html","title":"Drawing shapes using built-in methods","keywords":"","body":"Drawing shapes using built-in methods \nFor convenience when drawing common shapes such as circles, ellipses, rectangles, and rectangles with rounded corners, OpenFL has methods that draw these common shapes for you. These are the drawCircle(), drawEllipse(), drawRect(), and drawRoundRect() methods of the Graphics class. These methods may be used in place of the lineTo() and curveTo() methods. Note, however, that you must still specify line and fill styles before calling these methods.\nThe following example recreates the example of drawing red, green, and blue squares with width and height of 100 pixels. This code uses the drawRect() method, and additionally specifies that the fill color has an alpha of 50% (0.5):\nvar squareSize = 100;\nvar square = new Shape ();\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000, 0.5);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, squareSize, squareSize);\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00, 0.5);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (200, 0, squareSize, squareSize);\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0x0000FF, 0.5);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (400, 0, squareSize, squareSize);\nsquare.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (square);\n\nIn a Sprite or MovieClip object, the drawing content created with the graphics property always appears behind all child display objects that are contained by the object. Also, the graphics property content is not a separate display object so it does not appear in the list of a Sprite or MovieClip object’s children.

A gradient stroke is created with the lineGradientStyle() method and a gradient fill is created with the beginGradientFill() method.\nBoth methods accept the same parameters. The first four are required: type, colors, alphas, and ratios. The remaining four are optional but are useful for advanced customizing.\n\nThe first parameter specifies the type of gradient you are creating. Acceptable values are GradientType.LINEAR or GradientType.RADIAL.\nThe second parameter specifies the array of the color values to use. In a linear gradient, the colors will be arranged from left to right. In a radial gradient, they will be arranged from inside to outside. The order of the colors of the array represents the order that the colors will be drawn in the gradient.\nThe third parameter specifies the alpha transparency values of the corresponding colors in the previous parameter.\nThe fourth parameter specifies ratios, or the emphasis each color has within the gradient. Acceptable values range from 0-255. These values do not represent any width or height, but rather the position within the gradient; 0 represents the beginning of the gradient, 255 represents the end of the gradient. The array of ratios must increase sequentially and have the same number of entries as both the color and alpha arrays specified in the second and third parameters.\n\nAlthough the fifth parameter, the transformation matrix, is optional, it is commonly used because it provides an easy and powerful way to control the gradient’s appearance. This parameter accepts a Matrix instance. The easiest way to create a Matrix object for a gradient is to use the Matrix class’s createGradientBox() method.\nDefining a Matrix object for use with a gradient\nYou use the beginGradientFill() and lineGradientStyle() methods of the openfl.display.Graphics class to define gradients for use in shapes. When you define a gradient, you supply a matrix as one of the parameters of these methods.\nThe easiest way to define the matrix is by using the Matrix class’s createGradientBox() method, which creates a matrix that is used to define the gradient. You define the scale, rotation, and position of the gradient using the parameters passed to the createGradientBox() method. The createGradientBox() method accepts the following parameters:\n\nGradient box width: the width (in pixels) to which the gradient will spread\nGradient box height: the height (in pixels) to which the gradient will spread\nGradient box rotation: the rotation (in radians) that will be applied to the gradient\nHorizontal translation: how far (in pixels) the gradient is shifted horizontally\nVertical translation: how far (in pixels) the gradient is shifted vertically For example, consider a gradient with the following characteristics:\nGradientType.LINEAR\nTwo colors, green and blue, with the ratios array set to [0, 255]\nSpreadMethod.PAD\nInterpolationMethod.LINEAR_RGB\n\nThe following examples show gradients in which the rotation parameter of the createGradientBox() method differs as indicated, but all other settings stay the same:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 100;rotation = Math.PI/4; // 45°tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 100;rotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\n\nThe following examples show the effects on a green-to-blue linear gradient in which the rotation, tx, and ty parameters of the createGradientBox() method differ as indicated, but all other settings stay the same:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth = 50;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 50;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 50;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 50;rotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 50;rotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°tx = 0;ty = 50;\n\n\n\n\nThe width, height, tx, and ty parameters of the createGradientBox() method affect the size and position of a radial gradient fill as well, as the following example shows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth = 50;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 25;ty = 0;\n\n\n\n\nThe following code produces the last radial gradient illustrated:\nimport openfl.display.Shape;\nimport openfl.display.GradientType;\nimport openfl.geom.Matrix;\n\n...\n\nvar type = GradientType.RADIAL;\nvar colors = [0x00FF00, 0x000088];\nvar alphas = [1, 1];\nvar ratios = [0, 255];\nvar spreadMethod = SpreadMethod.PAD;\nvar interp = InterpolationMethod.LINEAR_RGB;\nvar focalPtRatio = 0;\n\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nvar boxWidth = 50;\nvar boxHeight = 100;\nvar boxRotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°\nvar tx = 25;\nvar ty = 0;\nmatrix.createGradientBox (boxWidth, boxHeight, boxRotation, tx, ty);\n\nvar square = new Shape ();\nsquare.graphics.beginGradientFill (type, colors, alphas, ratios, matrix, spreadMethod, interp, focalPtRatio);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\naddChild (square);\n\nNote that the width and height of the gradient fill is determined by the width and height of the gradient matrix rather than the width or height that is drawn using the Graphics object. When drawing with the Graphics object, you draw what exists at those coordinates in the gradient matrix. Even if you use one of the shape methods of a Graphics object such as drawRect(), the gradient does not stretch itself to the size of the shape that is drawn—the gradient’s size must be specified in the gradient matrix itself.\nThe following illustrates the visual difference between the dimensions of the gradient matrix and the dimensions of the draw itself:\nvar myShape = new Shape ();\nvar gradientBoxMatrix = new Matrix ();\ngradientBoxMatrix.createGradientBox (100, 40, 0, 0, 0);\nmyShape.graphics.beginGradientFill (GradientType.LINEAR, [0xFF0000, 0x00FF00, 0x0000FF], [1, 1, 1], [0, 128, 255], gradientBoxMatrix);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 50, 40);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 50, 100, 40);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 100, 150, 40);\nmyShape.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (myShape);\n\nThis code draws three gradients with the same fill style, specified with an equal distribution of red, green, and blue. The gradients are drawn using the drawRect() method with pixel widths of 50, 100, and 150 respectively. The gradient matrix which is specified in the beginGradientFill() method is created with a width of 100 pixels. This means that the first gradient will encompass only half of the gradient spectrum, the second will encompass all of it, and the third will encompass all of it and have an additional 50 pixels of blue extending to the right.\nThe lineGradientStyle() method works similarly to beginGradientFill() except that in addition to defining the gradient, you must specify the thickness of the stroke using the lineStyle() method before drawing. The following code draws a box with a red, green, and blue gradient stroke:\nvar myShape = new Shape ();\nvar gradientBoxMatrix = new Matrix ();\ngradientBoxMatrix.createGradientBox (200, 40, 0, 0, 0);\nmyShape.graphics.lineStyle (5, 0);\nmyShape.graphics.lineGradientStyle (GradientType.LINEAR, [0xFF0000, 0x00FF00, 0x0000FF], [1, 1, 1], [0, 128, 255], gradientBoxMatrix);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 200, 40);\nthis.addChild (myShape);\n\nFor more information on the Matrix class, see Using Matrix objects.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/using-the-math-class-with-drawing-methods.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/using-the-math-class-with-drawing-methods.html","title":"Using the Math class with drawing methods","keywords":"","body":"Using the Math class with drawing methods \nA Graphics object draws circles and squares, but can also draw more complex forms, particularly when the drawing methods are used in combination with the properties and methods of the Math class.

The drawing API enhancements for these runtimes expand upon the standard drawing methods so you can establish data sets to generate shapes, alter shapes at runtime, and create three-dimensional effects. The drawing API enhancements consolidate existing methods into alternative commands. These commands leverage vector arrays and enumeration classes to provide data sets for drawing methods. Using vector arrays allows for more complex shapes to render quickly and for developers to change the array values programmatically for dynamic shape rendering at runtime.\nThese advanced drawing features are described in the following sections: Drawing Paths, Using graphics data classes and About using drawTriangles().\nThe following tasks are things you’ll likely want to accomplish using the advanced drawing API in OpenFL:\n\nUsing Vector objects to store data for drawing methods\nDefining paths for drawing shapes programmatically in a single operation\nDefining winding rules to determine how overlapping shapes are filled\nReading the vector graphics content of a display object, such as to serialize and save the graphics data, to generate a spritesheet at runtime, or to draw a copy of the vector graphics content\nUsing triangles and drawing methods for three-dimensional effects\n\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter in this section:\n\nVector: An array of values all of the same data type.

For more information on Vector objects, see Indexed arrays.\nPath: A path is made up of one or more straight or curved segments. The beginning and end of each segment are marked by coordinates, which work like pins holding a wire in place. A path can be closed (for example, a circle), or open, with distinct endpoints (for example, a wavy line).\nWinding: The direction of a path as interpreted by the renderer; either positive (clockwise) or negative (counter- clockwise).\nGraphicsStroke: A class for setting the line style. While the term \"stroke\" isn’t part of the drawing API enhancements, the use of a class to designate a line style with its own fill property is part of the new drawing API.

With these methods, you can provide a series of Graphics.lineTo(), Graphics.curveTo(), or Graphics.moveTo() commands for the compiled project to execute in a single statement.\nThe GraphicsPathCommand enumeration class defines a set of constants that correspond to drawing commands. You pass a series of these constants (wrapped in a Vector instance) as a parameter for the Graphics.drawPath() method. Then with a single command you can render an entire shape, or several shapes. You can also alter the values passed to these methods to change an existing shape.\nIn addition to the Vector of drawing commands, the drawPath() method needs a set of coordinates that correspond to the coordinates for each drawing command.

The winding for a path is either positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise). The order in which the renderer interprets the coordinates provided by the vector for the data parameter determines the winding.\n\nPositive and negative winding\nA. Arrows indicate drawing direction B. Positively wound (clockwise) C. Negatively wound (counter-clockwise)\nAdditionally, notice that the Graphics.drawPath() method has an optional third parameter called \"winding\":\ndrawPath (commands:Vector, data:Vector, winding:String = GraphicsPathWinding.EVEN_ODD):Void\n\nIn this context, the third parameter is a string or a constant that specifies the winding or fill rule for intersecting paths. (The constant values are defined in the GraphicsPathWinding class as GraphicsPathWinding.EVEN_ODD or GraphicsPathWinding.NON_ZERO.) The winding rule is important when paths intersect.\nThe even-odd rule is the standard winding rule and is the rule used by the legacy drawing API. The even-odd rule is also the default rule for the Graphics.drawPath() method. With the even-odd winding rule, any intersecting paths alternate between open and closed fills. If two squares drawn with the same fill intersect, the area in which the intersection occurs is filled. Generally, adjacent areas are neither both filled nor both unfilled.\nThe non-zero rule, on the other hand, depends on winding (drawing direction) to determine whether areas defined by intersecting paths are filled. When paths of opposite winding intersect, the area defined is unfilled, much like with even-odd. For paths of the same winding, the area that would be unfilled is filled:\n\nWinding rules for intersecting areas\nA. Even-odd winding rule B. Non-zero winding rule\nWinding rule names\nThe names refer to a more specific rule that defines how these fills are managed. Positively wound paths are assigned a value of +1; negatively wound paths are assigned a value of -1. Starting from a point within an enclosed area of a shape, draw a line from that point extending out indefinitely. The number of times that line crosses a path, and the combined values of those paths, are used to determine the fill. For even-odd winding, the count of times the line crosses a path is used. When the count is odd, the area is filled. For even counts, the area is unfilled. For non-zero winding, the values assigned to the paths are used. When the combined values of the path are not 0, the area is filled. When the combined value is 0, the area is unfilled.\n\nWinding rule counts and fills\nA. Even-odd winding rule B. Non-zero winding rule\nUsing winding rules\nThese fill rules are complicated, but in some situations they are necessary. For example, consider drawing a star shape. With the standard even-odd rule, the shape would require ten different lines. With the non-zero winding rule, those ten lines are reduced to five. Here is the Haxe code for a star with five lines and a non-zero winding rule:\ngraphics.beginFill (0x60A0FF);\ngraphics.drawPath (Vector.ofArray ([1,2,2,2,2]), Vector.ofArray ([66, 10, 23, 127, 122, 50, 10, 49, 109, 127.0 ]), GraphicsPathWinding.NON_ZERO);\n\nAnd here is the star shape:\n\nA star shape using different winding rules\nA. Even-odd 10 lines B. Even-odd 5 lines C. Non-zero 5 lines\nAnd, as images are animated or used as textures on three-dimensional objects and overlap, the winding rules become more important.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/advanced-use-of-the-drawing-api/using-graphics-data-classes.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/advanced-use-of-the-drawing-api/using-graphics-data-classes.html","title":"Using graphics data classes","keywords":"","body":"Using graphics data classes \nThe enhanced drawing API includes a set of classes in the openfl.display package that implement the IGraphicsData interface.

You can then reuse the graphics data as the data source for other shape instances or to store drawing information for later use.\nNotice you have multiple fill classes for each style of fill, but only one stroke class. OpenFL has only one stroke IGraphicsData class because the stroke class uses the fill classes to define its style. So every stroke is actually defined by a combination of the stroke class and a fill class.

These utility methods simplify the task of defining or updating the commands and data values directly.\nDrawing with vector graphics data\nOnce you have a collection of IGraphicsData instances, use the Graphics class’s drawGraphicsData() method to render the graphics. The drawGraphicsData() method carries out a set of drawing instructions from a vector of IGraphicsData instances in sequential order:\n// stroke object\nvar stroke = new GraphicsStroke (3);\nstroke.joints = JointStyle.MITER;\nstroke.fill = new GraphicsSolidFill (0x102020); // solid stroke\n\n// fill object\nvar fill = new GraphicsGradientFill ();\nfill.colors = [0x0000FF, 0xEEFFEE];\nfill.matrix = new Matrix ();\nfill.matrix.createGradientBox (70, 70, Math.PI/2);\n\n// path object\nvar path = new GraphicsPath (new Vector (), new Vector ());\npath.commands.push (GraphicsPathCommand.MOVE_TO, GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO, GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO);\npath.data.push (125, 0, 50, 100, 175, 0);\n\n// combine objects for complete drawing\nvar drawing = new Vector ();\ndrawing.push (stroke, fill, path);\n\n// draw the drawing graphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\n\nBy modifying one value in the path used by the drawing in the example, the shape can be redrawn multiple times for a more complex image:\n// draw the drawing multiple times\n// change one value to modify each variation\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] += 200;\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] -= 150;\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] += 100;\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] -= 50;\ngraphicsS.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\n\nThough IGraphicsData objects can define fill and stroke styles, the fill and stroke styles are not a requirement. In other words, Graphics class methods can be used to set styles while IGraphicsData objects can be used to draw a saved collection of paths, or vice-versa.\nNote: Use the Graphics.clear() method to clear out a previous drawing before starting a new one; unless you're adding on to the original drawing, as seen in the example above. As you change a single portion of a path or collection of IGraphicsData objects, redraw the entire drawing to see the changes.\nWhen using graphics data classes, the fill is rendered whenever three or more points are drawn, because the shape is inherently closed at that point. Even though the fill closes, the stroke does not, and this behavior is different than when using multiple Graphics.lineTo() or Graphics.moveTo() commands.\nReading vector graphics data\nIn addition to drawing vector content to a display object, you can use the Graphics class’s readGraphicsData() method to obtain a data representation of the vector graphics content of a display object. This can be used to create a snapshot of a graphic to save, copy, create a spritesheet at run time, and more.\nCalling the readGraphicsData() method returns a Vector instance containing IGraphicsData objects.

Bitmap graphics, also known as raster graphics, are composed of tiny squares (pixels) that are arranged in a rectangular grid formation. Vector graphics are composed of mathematically generated geometric shapes such as lines, curves, and polygons.\nBitmap images are defined by the width and height of the image, measured in pixels, and the number of bits contained in each pixel, which represents the number of colors a pixel can contain. In the case of a bitmap image that utilizes the RGB color model, the pixels are made up of three bytes: red, green, and blue. Each of these bytes contains a value ranging from 0 to 255. When the bytes are combined within the pixel, they produce a color similar to an artist mixing paint colors. For example, a pixel containing byte values of red-255, green-102 and blue-0 would produce a vibrant orange color.\nThe quality of a bitmap image is determined by combining the resolution of the image with its color depth bit value. Resolution relates to the number of pixels contained within an image. The greater the number of pixels, the higher the resolution and the finer the image appears. Color depth relates to the amount of information a pixel can contain. For example, an image that has a color depth value of 16 bits per pixel cannot represent the same number of colors as an image that has a color depth of 48 bits. As a result, the 48-bit image will have smoother degrees of shading than its 16-bit counterpart.\nBecause bitmap graphics are resolution-dependent, they don’t scale very well. This is most noticeable when bitmap images are scaled up in size. Scaling up a bitmap usually results in a loss of detail and quality.\nBitmap file formats\nBitmap images are grouped into a number of common file formats. These formats use different types of compression algorithms to reduce file size, as well as optimize image quality based on the end purpose of the image. The bitmap image formats supported by Adobe runtimes are BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, and TIFF.\nBMP\nThe BMP (bit mapped) format is a default image format used by the Microsoft Windows operating system. It does not use any form of compression algorithm and as such usually results in large file sizes.\nGIF\nThe Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) was originally developed by CompuServe in 1987 as a means to transmit images with 256 colors (8-bit color). The format provides small file sizes and is ideal for web-based images. Because of this format’s limited color palette, GIF images are generally not suitable for photographs, which typically require high degrees of shading and color gradients. GIF images permit single-bit transparency, which allows colors to be mapped as clear (or transparent). This results in the background color of a web page showing through the image where the transparency has been mapped.\nJPEG\nDeveloped by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), the JPEG (often written JPG) image format uses a lossy compression algorithm to allow 24-bit color depth with a small file size. Lossy compression means that each time the image is saved, the image loses quality and data but results in a smaller file size. The JPEG format is ideal for photographs because it is capable of displaying millions of colors. The ability to control the degree of compression applied to an image allows you to manipulate image quality and file size.\nPNG\nThe Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was produced as an open-source alternative to the patented GIF file format. PNGs support up to 64-bit color depth, allowing for up to 16 million colors. Because PNG is a relatively new format, some older browsers don’t support PNG files. Unlike JPGs, PNGs use lossless compression, which means that none of the image data is lost when the image is saved. PNG files also support alpha transparency, which allows for up to 256 levels of transparency.\nTIFF\nThe Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) was the cross-platform format of choice before the PNG was introduced. The drawback with the TIFF format is that because of the many different varieties of TIFF, there is no single reader that can handle every version. In addition, no web browsers currently support the format. TIFF can use either lossy or lossless compression, and is able to handle device-specific color spaces (such as CMYK).\nTransparent bitmaps and opaque bitmaps\nBitmap images that use either the GIF or PNG formats can have an extra byte (alpha channel) added to each pixel. This extra pixel byte represents the transparency value of the pixel.\nGIF images allow single-bit transparency, which means that you can specify a single color, from a 256-color palette, to be transparent. PNG images, on the other hand, can have up to 256 levels of transparency. This function is especially beneficial when images or text are required to blend into backgrounds.\nOpenFL replicates this extra transparency pixel byte within the BitmapData class. Similar to the PNG transparency model, OpenFL offers up to 256 levels of transparency.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following list contains important terms that you will encounter when learning about bitmap graphics:\nAlpha The level of transparency (or more accurately, opacity) in a color or an image. The amount of alpha is often described as the alpha channel value.\nARGB color A color scheme where each pixel’s color is a mixture of red, green, and blue color values, and its transparency is specified as an alpha value.\nColor channel Commonly, colors are represented as a mixture of a few basic colors—usually (for computer graphics) red, green, and blue. Each basic color is considered a color channel; the amount of color in each color channel, mixed together, determines the final color.\nColor depth Also known as bit depth, this refers to the amount of computer memory that is devoted to each pixel, which in turn determines the number of possible colors that can be represented in the image.\nPixel The smallest unit of information in a bitmap image—essentially a dot of color.\nResolution The pixel dimensions of an image, which determines the level of fine-grained detail contained in the image. Resolution is often expressed in terms of width and height in number of pixels.\nRGB color A color scheme where each pixel’s color is represented as a mixture of red, green, and blue color values.\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/the-bitmap-and-bitmapdata-classes.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/the-bitmap-and-bitmapdata-classes.html","title":"The Bitmap and BitmapData classes","keywords":"","body":"The Bitmap and BitmapData classes \nThe main OpenFL classes for working with bitmap images are the Bitmap class, which is used to display bitmap images on the screen, and the BitmapData class, which is used to access and manipulate the raw image data of a bitmap.\nMore Help topics\n\nopenfl.display.Bitmap\nopenfl.display.BitmapData\n\nUnderstanding the Bitmap class \nAs a subclass of the DisplayObject class, the Bitmap class is the main OpenFL class used for displaying bitmap images. These images may have been loaded via the openfl.display.Loader class or created dynamically using the Bitmap() constructor. When loading an image from an external source, a Bitmap object can only use GIF, JPEG, or PNG format images. Once instantiated, the Bitmap instance can be considered a wrapper for a BitmapData object that needs to be rendered to the Stage. Because a Bitmap instance is a display object, all the characteristics and functionality of display objects can be used to manipulate a Bitmap instance as well. For more information about working with display objects, see Display programming.\nPixel snapping and smoothing \nIn addition to the functionality common to all display objects, the Bitmap class provides some additional features that are specific to bitmap images.\nThe pixelSnapping property of the Bitmap class determines whether or not a Bitmap object snaps to its nearest pixel. This property accepts one of three constants defined in the PixelSnapping class: ALWAYS, AUTO, and NEVER.\nThe syntax for applying pixel snapping is as follows:\nmyBitmap.pixelSnapping = PixelSnapping.ALWAYS;\n\nOften, when bitmap images are scaled, they become blurred and distorted. To help reduce this distortion, use the smoothing property of the BitmapData class. This Boolean property, when set to true, smooths, or anti-aliases, the pixels within the image when it is scaled. This gives the image a clearer and more natural appearance.\nUnderstanding the BitmapData class \nThe BitmapData class, which is in the openfl.display package, can be likened to a photographic snapshot of the pixels contained within a loaded or dynamically created bitmap image. This snapshot is represented by an array of pixel data within the object. The BitmapData class also contains a series of built-in methods that are useful for creation and manipulation of pixel data.\nTo instantiate a BitmapData object, use the following code:\nvar myBitmap = new BitmapData (width:Int, height:Int, transparent:Bool, fillColor:Int);\n\nThe width and height parameters specify the size of the bitmap. The maximum size of a bitmap is dependent on the operating system.\n\nThe transparent parameter specifies whether the bitmap data includes an alpha channel (true) or not (false). The fillColor parameter is a 32-bit color value that specifies the background color, as well as the transparency value (if it has been set to true). The following example creates a BitmapData object with an orange background that is 50 percent transparent:\nvar myBitmap = new BitmapData (150, 150, true, 0x80FF3300);\nTo render a newly created BitmapData object to the screen, assign it to or wrap it in a Bitmap instance. To do this, you can either pass the BitmapData object as a parameter of the Bitmap object’s constructor, or you can assign it to the bitmapData property of an existing Bitmap instance. You must also add the Bitmap instance to the display list by calling the addChild() or addChildAt() methods of the display object container that will contain the Bitmap instance.

You use the getPixel() method to read these pixel values.\nThe getPixel() method retrieves an RGB value from a set of x, y (pixel) coordinates that are passed as a parameter. If any of the pixels that you want to manipulate include transparency (alpha channel) information, you need to use the getPixel32() method. This method also retrieves an RGB value, but unlike with getPixel(), the value returned by getPixel32() contains additional data that represents the alpha channel (transparency) value of the selected pixel.\nAlternatively, if you simply want to change the color or transparency of a pixel contained within a bitmap, you can use the setPixel() or setPixel32() method. To set a pixel’s color, simply pass in the x, y coordinates and the color value to one of these methods.\nThe following example uses setPixel() to draw a cross on a green BitmapData background. It then uses getPixel() to retrieve the color value from the pixel at the coordinate 50, 50 and traces the returned value.\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\n\n...\n\nvar myBitmapData = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x009900);\n\nfor (i in 0...100) {\n\n    var red = 0xFF0000;\n    myBitmapData.setPixel (50, i, red);\n    myBitmapData.setPixel (i, 50, red);\n\n}\n\nvar myBitmapImage = new Bitmap (myBitmapData);\naddChild (myBitmapImage);\n\nvar pixelValue = myBitmapData.getPixel (50, 50);\ntrace (StringTools.hex (pixelValue, 6));\n\nIf you want to read the value of a group of pixels, as opposed to a single pixel, use the getPixels() method. This method generates a byte array from a rectangular region of pixel data that is passed as a parameter. Each of the elements of the byte array (in other words, the pixel values) are unsigned integers—32-bit, unmultiplied pixel values.\nConversely, to change (or set) the value of a group of pixels, use the setPixels() method. This method expects two parameters (rect and inputByteArray), which are combined to output a rectangular region (rect) of pixel data (inputByteArray).\nAs data is read (and written) out of the inputByteArray, the ByteArray.readUnsignedInt() method is called for each of the pixels in the array. If, for some reason, the inputByteArray doesn't contain a full rectangle worth of pixel data, the method stops processing the image data at that point.\nIt's important to remember that, for both getting and setting pixel data, the byte array expects 32-bit alpha, red, green, blue (ARGB) pixel values.\nThe following example uses the getPixels() and setPixels() methods to copy a group of pixels from one BitmapData object to another:\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.utils.ByteArray;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar bitmapDataObject1 = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x006666FF);\nvar bitmapDataObject2 = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x00FF0000);\n\nvar rect = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\nvar bytes = bitmapDataObject1.getPixels (rect);\n\nbytes.position = 0;\nbitmapDataObject2.setPixels (rect, bytes);\n\nvar bitmapImage1 = new Bitmap (bitmapDataObject1);\naddChild (bitmapImage1);\nvar bitmapImage2 = new Bitmap (bitmapDataObject2);\naddChild (bitmapImage2);\nbitmapImage2.x = 110;\n\nPixel-level collision detection \nThe BitmapData.hitTest() method performs pixel-level collision detection between the bitmap data and another object or point.\nThe BitmapData.hitTest() method accepts five parameters:\n\nfirstPoint (Point): This parameter refers to the pixel position of the upper-left corner of the first BitmapData upon which the hit test is being performed.\nfirstAlphaThreshold (uint): This parameter specifies the highest alpha channel value that is considered opaque for this hit test.\nsecondObject (Object): This parameter represents the area of impact. The secondObject object can be a Rectangle, Point, Bitmap, or BitmapData object. This object represents the hit area on which the collision detection is being performed.\nsecondBitmapDataPoint (Point): This optional parameter is used to define a pixel location in the second BitmapData object. This parameter is used only when the value of secondObject is a BitmapData object. The default is null.\nsecondAlphaThreshold (uint): This optional parameter represents the highest alpha channel value that is considered opaque in the second BitmapData object. The default value is 1. This parameter is only used when the value of secondObject is a BitmapData object and both BitmapData objects are transparent.\n\nWhen performing collision detection on opaque images, keep in mind that OpenFL treats the image as though it were a fully opaque rectangle (or bounding box). Alternatively, when performing pixel-level hit testing on images that are transparent, both of the images are required to be transparent. In addition to this, OpenFL uses the alpha threshold parameters to determine at what point the pixels change from being transparent to opaque.\nThe following example creates three bitmap images and checks for pixel collision using two different collision points (one returns false, the other true):\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.geom.Point;\n\n...\n\nvar bmd1 = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x000000FF);\nvar bmd2 = new BitmapData (20, 20, false, 0x00FF3300);\n\nvar bm1 = new Bitmap (bmd1);\nthis.addChild (bm1);\n\n// Create a red square.\nvar redSquare1 = new Bitmap (bmd2);\nthis.addChild (redSquare1);\nredSquare1.x = 0;\n\n// Create a second red square.\nvar redSquare2 = new Bitmap (bmd2);\nthis.addChild (redSquare2);\nredSquare2.x = 150;\nredSquare2.y = 150;\n\n// Define the point at the top-left corner of the bitmap.\nvar pt1 = new Point (0, 0);\n\n// Define the point at the center of redSquare1.\nvar pt2 = new Point (20, 20);\n\n// Define the point at the center of redSquare2.\nvar pt3 = new Point (160, 160);\n\ntrace (bmd1.hitTest (pt1, 0xFF, pt2)); // true\ntrace (bmd1.hitTest (pt1, 0xFF, pt3)); // false\n\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/copying-bitmap-data.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/copying-bitmap-data.html","title":"Copying bitmap data","keywords":"","body":"Copying bitmap data \nTo copy bitmap data from one image to another, you can use several methods: clone(), copyPixels(), copyChannel(), draw(), and drawWithQuality().\nAs its name suggests, the clone() method lets you clone, or sample, bitmap data from one BitmapData object to another. When called, the method returns a new BitmapData object that is an exact clone of the original instance it was copied from.\nThe following example clones a copy of an orange (parent) square and places the clone beside the original parent square:\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\n\n...\n\nvar myParentSquareBitmap = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x00ff3300);\nvar myClonedChild = myParentSquareBitmap.clone ();\n\nvar myParentSquareContainer = new Bitmap (myParentSquareBitmap);\nthis.addChild (myParentSquareContainer);\n\nvar myClonedChildContainer = new Bitmap (myClonedChild);\nthis.addChild (myClonedChildContainer);\nmyClonedChildContainer.x = 110;\n\nThe copyPixels() method is a quick and easy way of copying pixels from one BitmapData object to another. The method takes a rectangular snapshot (defined by the sourceRect parameter) of the source image and copies it to another rectangular area (of equal size). The location of the newly \"pasted\" rectangle is defined within the destPoint parameter.\nThe copyChannel() method samples a predefined color channel value (alpha, red, green, or blue) from a source BitmapData object and copies it into a channel of a destination BitmapData object. Calling this method does not affect the other channels in the destination BitmapData object.\nThe draw() and drawWithQuality() methods draw, or render, the graphical content from a source sprite, movie clip, or other display object on to a new bitmap. Using the matrix, colorTransform, blendMode, and destination clipRect parameters, you can modify the way in which the new bitmap is rendered. This method uses the vector renderer in OpenFL to generate the data.\nWhen you call draw() or drawWithQuality(), you pass the source object (sprite, movie clip, or other display object) as the first parameter, as demonstrated here:\nmyBitmap.draw (movieClip);\n\nIf the source object has had any transformations (color, matrix, and so forth) applied to it after it was originally loaded, these transformations are not copied across to the new object. If you want to copy the transformations to the new bitmap, then you need to copy the value of the transform property from the original object to the transform property of the Bitmap object that uses the new BitmapData object.\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/compressing-bitmap-data.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/compressing-bitmap-data.html","title":"Compressing bitmap data","keywords":"","body":"Compressing bitmap data \nThe openfl.display.BitmapData.encode() method lets you natively compress bitmap data into one of the following image compression formats:\n\nPNG - Uses PNG compression, optionally using fast compression, which emphasizes compression speed over file size.

A noise effect can be likened to the static that appears on an untuned television screen.\nTo apply a noise effect to a a bitmap, use the noise() method. This method applies a random color value to pixels within a specified area of a bitmap image.\nThis method accepts five parameters:\n\nrandomSeed (Int): The random seed number that determines the pattern. Despite its name, this number actually creates the same results if the same number is passed. To get a true random result, use the Math.random() method to pass a random number for this parameter.\nlow (Int): This parameter refers to the lowest value to be generated for each pixel (0 to 255). The default value is 0. Setting this value lower results in a darker noise pattern, while setting it to a higher value results in a brighter pattern.\nhigh (Int): This parameter refers to the highest value to be generated for each pixel (0 to 255). The default value is 255. Setting this value lower results in a darker noise pattern, while setting it to a higher value results in a brighter pattern.\nchannelOptions (Int): This parameter specifies to which color channel of the bitmap object the noise pattern will be applied. The number can be a combination of any of the four color channel ARGB values. The default value is 7.\ngrayScale (Bool): When set to true, this parameter applies the randomSeed value to the bitmap pixels, effectively washing all color out of the image. The alpha channel is not affected by this parameter. The default value is false.\n\nThe following example creates a bitmap image and applies a blue noise pattern to it:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapDataChannel;\n\nclass BitmapNoise1 extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var myBitmap = new BitmapData (250, 250, false, 0xff000000);\n        myBitmap.noise (500, 0, 255, BitmapDataChannel.BLUE, false);\n\n        var image = new Bitmap (myBitmap);\n        addChild (image);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIf you want to create a more organic-looking texture, use the perlinNoise() method. The perlinNoise() method produces realistic, organic textures that are ideal for smoke, clouds, water, fire, or even explosions.\nBecause it is generated by an algorithm, the perlinNoise() method uses less memory than bitmap-based textures. However, it can still have an impact on processor usage, slowing down your content and causing the screen to be redrawn more slowly than the frame rate, especially on older computers. This is mainly due to the floating-point calculations that need to occur to process the perlin noise algorithms.\nThe method accepts nine parameters (the first six are required):\n\nbaseX (Float): Determines the x (size) value of patterns created.\nbaseY (Float): Determines the y (size) value of the patterns created.\nnumOctaves (Int): Number of octaves or individual noise functions to combine to create this noise. Larger numbers of octaves create images with greater detail but also require more processing time.\nrandomSeed (Int): The random seed number works exactly the same way as it does in the noise() function. To get a true random result, use the Math.random() method to pass a random number for this parameter.\nstitch (Bool): If set to true, this method attempts to stitch (or smooth) the transition edges of the image to create seamless textures for tiling as a bitmap fill.\nfractalNoise (Bool): This parameter relates to the edges of the gradients being generated by the method. If set to true, the method generates fractal noise that smooths the edges of the effect. If set to false, it generates turbulence. An image with turbulence has visible discontinuities in the gradient that can make it better approximate sharper visual effects, like flames and ocean waves.\nchannelOptions (Int): The channelOptions parameter works exactly the same way as it does in the noise() method. It specifies to which color channel (of the bitmap) the noise pattern is applied. The number can be a combination of any of the four color channel ARGB values. The default value is 7.\ngrayScale (Bool): The grayScale parameter works exactly the same way as it does in the noise() method. If set to true, it applies the randomSeed value to the bitmap pixels, effectively washing all color out of the image. The default value is false.\noffsets (Array): An array of points that correspond to x and y offsets for each octave. By manipulating the offset values, you can smoothly scroll the layers of the image. Each point in the offset array affects a specific octave noise function. The default value is null.\n\nThe following example creates a 150 x 150 pixel BitmapData object that calls the perlinNoise() method to generate a green and blue cloud effect:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapDataChannel;\n\nclass BitmapNoise2 extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var myBitmapDataObject = new BitmapData (150, 150, false, 0x00FF0000);\n\n        var seed = Math.floor (Math.random () * 100);\n        var channels = BitmapDataChannel.GREEN | BitmapDataChannel.BLUE;\n\n        myBitmapDataObject.perlinNoise (100, 80, 6, seed, false, true, channels, false, null);\n\n        var myBitmap = new Bitmap (myBitmapDataObject);\n        addChild (myBitmap);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/scrolling-bitmaps.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/scrolling-bitmaps.html","title":"Scrolling bitmaps","keywords":"","body":"Scrolling bitmaps \nImagine you have created a street mapping application where each time the user moves the map you are required to update the view (even if the map has been moved by just a few pixels).\nOne way to create this functionality would be to re-render a new image containing the updated map view each time the user moves the map. Alternatively, you could create a large single image and use the scroll() method.\nThe scroll() method copies an on-screen bitmap and then pastes it to a new offset location—specified by (x, y) parameters. If a portion of the bitmap happens to reside off-stage, this gives the effect that the image has shifted. When combined with a timer function (or an enterFrame event), you can make the image appear to be animating or scrolling.\nThe following example takes the previous perlin noise example and generates a larger bitmap image (three-fourths of which is rendered off-stage). The scroll() method is then applied, along with an enterFrame event listener that offsets the image by one pixel in a diagonally downward direction.

Whenever you create a movie clip symbol in Flash, Flash adds the symbol to the library of that Flash document. By default, this symbol becomes an instance of the MovieClip class, and as such has the properties and methods of the MovieClip class.\nWhen an instance of a movie clip symbol is placed on the Stage, the movie clip automatically progresses through its timeline (if it has more than one frame) unless its playback is altered using Haxe code. It is this timeline that distinguishes the MovieClip class, allowing you to create animation through motion or shape tweens through the Flash authoring tool. By contrast, with a display object that is an instance of the Sprite class, you can create animation only by programmatically changing the object’s values.\nIn OpenFL, a movie clip is only one of many display objects that can appear on the screen. If a timeline is not necessary for the function of a display object, using the Shape class or Sprite class in lieu of the MovieClip class may improve rendering performance. For more information on choosing the appropriate display object for a task, see Choosing a DisplayObject subclass.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms related to movie clips:\nAVM1 SWF A project created using ActionScript 1.0 or ActionScript 2.0, usually targeting Flash Player 8 or earlier.\nAVM2 SWF A project created using Haxe or ActionScript 3.0 for Adobe Flash Player 9 or later.\nExternal SWF A SWF file that is created separately from the current project and is intended to be loaded as an asset into the project, whether for Flash Player or on another OpenFL target platform.\nFrame The smallest division of time on the timeline. As with a motion picture filmstrip, each frame is like a snapshot of the animation in time, and when frames are played quickly in sequence, the effect of animation is created.\nTimeline The metaphorical representation of the series of frames that make up a movie clip’s animation sequence. The timeline of a MovieClip object is equivalent to the timeline in the Flash authoring tool.\nPlayhead A marker identifying the location (frame) in the timeline that is being displayed at a given moment.\n"},"working-with-movie-clips/working-with-movieclip-objects.html":{"url":"working-with-movie-clips/working-with-movieclip-objects.html","title":"Working with MovieClip objects","keywords":"","body":"Working with MovieClip objects \nWhen you publish a project, Flash converts all movie clip symbol instances on the Stage to MovieClip objects. You can make a movie clip symbol available to your Haxe code by giving it an instance name in the Instance Name field of the Property inspector. When the project is created, Flash generates the code that creates the MovieClip instance on the Stage and declares a variable using the instance name. If you have named movie clips that are nested inside other named movie clips, those child movie clips are treated like properties of the parent movie clip—you can access the child movie clip using dot syntax. For example, if a movie clip with the instance name childClip is nested within another clip with the instance name parentClip, you can make the child clip’s timeline animation play by calling this code:\nparentClip.childClip.play ();\n\nNote: : Children instances placed on the Stage in the Flash authoring tool cannot be accessed by code from within the constructor of a parent instance since they have not been created at that point in code execution. Before accessing the child, the parent must instead either create the child instance by code or delay access to a callback function that listens for the child to dispatch its Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE event.\nWhile some legacy methods and properties of the ActionScript 2.0 MovieClip class remain the same, others have changed. All properties prefixed with an underscore have been renamed. For example, _width and _height properties are now accessed as width and height, while _xscale and _yscale are now accessed as scaleX and scaleY. For a complete list of the properties and methods of the MovieClip class, consult the API Reference.\n"},"working-with-movie-clips/controlling-movie-clip-playback.html":{"url":"working-with-movie-clips/controlling-movie-clip-playback.html","title":"Controlling movie clip playback","keywords":"","body":"Controlling movie clip playback \nOpenFL use the metaphor of a timeline to convey animation or a change in state. Any visual element that employs a timeline must be either a MovieClip object or extend from the MovieClip class. While OpenFL can direct any movie clip to stop, play, or go to another point on the timeline, it cannot be used to dynamically create a timeline or add content at specific frames; this is only possible using the Flash authoring tool.\nWhen a MovieClip is playing, it progresses along its timeline at a speed dictated by the frame rate of the project. Alternatively, you can override this setting by setting the Stage.frameRate property in Haxe code.\nPlaying movie clips and stopping playback\nThe play() and stop() methods allow basic control of a movie clip across its timeline. For example, suppose you have a movie clip symbol on the Stage which contains an animation of a bicycle moving across the screen, with its instance name set to bicycle. If the following code is attached to a keyframe on the main timeline,\nbicycle.stop ();\n\nthe bicycle will not move (its animation will not play). The bicycle’s movement could start through some other user interaction. For example, if you had a button named startButton, the following code on a keyframe on the main timeline would make it so that clicking the button causes the animation to play:\n// This function will be called when the button is clicked. It causes the\n// bicycle animation to play.\nprivate function playAnimation (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    bicycle.play ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\n// Register the function as a listener with the button.\nstartButton.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, playAnimation);\n\nFast-forwarding and rewinding \nThe play() and stop() methods are not the only way of controlling playback in a movie clip. You can also move the playhead forward or backward along the timeline manually by using the nextFrame() and prevFrame() methods. Calling either of these methods stops playback and moves the playhead one frame forward or backward, respectively.\nUsing the play() method is analogous to calling nextFrame() every time the movie clip object’s enterFrame event is triggered. Along these lines, you could make the bicycle movie clip play backwards by creating an event listener for the enterFrame event and telling bicycle to go to its previous frame in the listener function, as follows:\n// This function is called when the enterFrame event is triggered, meaning\n// it's called once per frame.\nprivate function everyFrame (event:Event):Void {\n\n    if (bicycle.currentFrame == 1) {\n\n        bicycle.gotoAndStop (bicycle.totalFrames);\n\n    } else {\n\n        bicycle.prevFrame ();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n...\n\nbicycle.addEventListener (Event.ENTER_FRAME, everyFrame);\n\nIn normal playback, if a movie clip contains more than a single frame, it will loop indefinitely when playing; that is, it will return to Frame 1 if it progresses past its final frame. When you use prevFrame() or nextFrame(), this behavior does not happen automatically (calling prevFrame() when the playhead is on Frame 1 doesn’t move the playhead to the last frame). The if condition in the example above checks to see if the playhead has progressed backwards to the first frame, and sets the playhead ahead to its final frame, effectively creating a continuous loop of the movie clip playing backwards.\nJumping to a different frame and using frame labels \nSending a movie clip to a new frame is a simple affair. Calling either gotoAndPlay() or gotoAndStop() will jump the movie clip to the frame number specified as a parameter. Alternatively, you can pass a string that matches the name of a frame label. Any frame on the timeline can be assigned a label. To do this, select a frame on the timeline and then enter a name in the Frame Label field on the Property inspector.\nThe advantages of using frame labels instead of numbers are particularly evident when creating a complex movie clip. When the number of frames, layers, and tweens in an animation becomes large, consider labeling important frames with explanatory descriptions that represent shifts in the behavior of the movie clip (for example, \"off,\" \"walking,\" or \"running\"). This improves code readability and also provides flexibility, since function calls that go to a labeled frame are pointers to a single reference—the label—rather than a specific frame number. If later on you decide to move a particular segment of the animation to a different frame, you will not need to change your Haxe code as long as you keep the same label for the frames in the new location.\nTo represent frame labels in code, OpenFL includes the FrameLabel class. Each instance of this class represents a single frame label, and has a name property representing the name of the frame label as specified in the Property inspector, and a frame property representing the frame number of the frame where the label is placed on the timeline.\nIn order to get access to the FrameLabel instances associated with a movie clip instance, the MovieClip class includes two properties that directly return FrameLabel objects. The currentLabels property returns an array that consists of all FrameLabel objects across the entire timeline of a movie clip. The currentLabel property returns a string containing the name of the frame label encountered most recently along the timeline.\nSuppose you were creating a movie clip named robot and had labeled the various states of its animation. You could set up a condition that checks the currentLabel property to access the current state of robot, as in the following code:\nif (robot.currentLabel == \"walking\") {\n\n    // do something\n\n}\n\nFlash Player 11.3 added the frameLabel event to the FrameLabel class. You can assign an event handler to the FrameLabel instance that represents a frame label. The event is dispatched when the playhead enters the frame.\nThe following example creates a FrameLabel instance for the second frame label in the Array of frame labels for the MovieClip. It then registers an event handler for the frameLabel event:\nvar myFrameLabel = robot.currentLabels[1];\nmyFrameLabel.addEventListener (Event.FRAME_LABEL, onFrameLabel);\n\n...\n\nprivate function onFrameLabel (e:Event):Void {\n\n    //do something\n\n}\n\n"},"working-with-movie-clips/creating-movieclip-objects-with-haxe.html":{"url":"working-with-movie-clips/creating-movieclip-objects-with-haxe.html","title":"Creating MovieClip objects with Haxe","keywords":"","body":"Creating MovieClip objects with Haxe \nOne way of adding content to the screen in OpenFL is by dragging assets from the library onto the Stage in the Flash authoring environment, but that is not the only workflow. For complex projects, experienced developers commonly prefer to create movie clips programatically. This approach brings several advantages: easier re-use of code, faster compile-time speed, and more sophisticated modifications that are available only to Haxe code.\nThe display list API of OpenFL streamlines the process of dynamically creating MovieClip objects. The ability to instantiate a MovieClip instance directly, separate from the process of adding it to the display list, provides flexibility and simplicity without sacrificing control.\nIn Haxe, when you create a movie clip (or any other display object) instance programatically, it is not visible on the screen until it is added to the display list by calling the addChild() or the addChildAt() method on a display object container. This allows you to create a movie clip, set its properties, and even call methods before it is rendered to the screen. For more information on working with the display list, see Working with display object containers.\nExporting library symbols for Haxe\nBy default, instances of movie clip symbols in a Flash document’s library cannot be dynamically created (that is, created using only Haxe code). This is because each symbol that is exported for use in Haxe adds to the size of your project, and it’s recognized that some symbols might not be intended for use on the stage. For this reason, in order to make a symbol available in Haxe, you must specify that the symbol should be exported for Haxe.\nTo export a symbol for Haxe code:\n\nSelect the symbol in the Library panel and open its Symbol Properties dialog box.\nIf necessary, activate the Advanced settings.\nIn the Linkage section, activate the \"Export for ActionScript\" checkbox. This will activate the Class and Base Class fields, and will also make it available to Haxe when building with OpenFL.\n\nBy default, the Class field is populated with the symbol name, with spaces removed (for example, a symbol named \"Tree House\" would become \"TreeHouse\"). To specify that the symbol should use a custom class for its behavior, enter the full name of the class including its package in this field. If you want to be able to create instances of the symbol in Haxe code, but don’t need to add any additional behavior, you can leave the class name as-is.\nThe Base Class field’s value defaults to openfl.display.MovieClip (which will become openfl.display.MovieClip when including the SWF asset in OpenFL). If you want your symbol to extend the functionality of another customer class, you can specify that class’s name instead, as long as that class extends the Sprite (or MovieClip) class.\n\nPress the OK button to save the changes.\n\nAt this point, if Flash can’t find a linked SWC file or an external ActionScript file with a definition for the specified class (for instance, if you didn’t need to add additional behavior for the symbol), a warning is displayed:\nA definition for this class could not be found in the classpath, so one will be automatically generated in the project upon export.\nYou can disregard this warning if your library symbol does not require unique functionality beyond the functionality of the MovieClip class.\nIf you do not provide a class for your symbol, Flash will create a class for your symbol equivalent to this one:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.MovieClip;\n\nclass ExampleMovieClip extends MovieClip {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        super ();\n\n    }\n\n}\nIf you do want to add extra Haxe functionality to your symbol, add the appropriate properties and methods to the code structure below. For example, suppose you have a movie clip symbol containing a circle of 50 pixels width and 50 pixels height, and the symbol is specified to be exported for Haxe with a class named Circle. The following code, when placed in a Circle.hx file, extends the MovieClip class and provides the symbol with the additional methods getArea() and getCircumference():\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.MovieClip;\n\nclass Circle extends MovieClip {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        super ();\n\n    }\n\n    public function getArea ():Float {\n\n        // The formula is Pi times the radius squared.\n        return Math.PI * Math.pow ((width / 2), 2);\n\n    }\n\n    public function getCircumference ():Float {\n\n        // The formula is Pi times the diameter.\n        return Math.PI * width;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe following code, placed on a keyframe on Frame 1 of the Flash document, will create an instance of the symbol and display it on the screen:\nvar c = new Circle ();\naddChild (c);\n\ntrace (c.width);\ntrace (c.height);\ntrace (c.getArea ());\ntrace (c.getCircumference ());\n\nThis code demonstrates Haxe-based instantiation as an alternative to dragging individual assets onto the Stage. It creates a circle that has all of the properties of a movie clip and also has the custom methods defined in the Circle class. This is a very basic example—your library symbol can specify any number of properties and methods in its class.\nHaxe-based instantiation is powerful, because it allows you to dynamically create large quantities of instances that would be tedious to arrange manually. It is also flexible, because you can customize each instance’s properties as it is created. You can get a sense of both of these benefits by using a loop to dynamically create several Circle instances. With the Circle symbol and class described previously in your Flash document’s library, place the following code on a keyframe on Frame 1:\nimport openfl.geom.ColorTransform;\n\n...\n\nvar totalCircles = 10;\n\nfor (i in 0...totalCircles) {\n\n    // Create a new Circle instance.\n    var c = new Circle ();\n\n    // Place the new Circle at an x coordinate that will space the circles\n    // evenly across the Stage.\n    c.x = (stage.stageWidth / totalCircles) * i;\n\n    // Place the Circle instance at the vertical center of the Stage.\n    c.y = stage.stageHeight / 2;\n\n    // Change the Circle instance to a random color\n    c.transform.colorTransform = getRandomColor ();\n\n    // Add the Circle instance to the current timeline.\n    addChild (c);\n\n}\n\n...\n\nprivate function getRandomColor ():ColorTransform {\n\n    // Generate random values for the red, green, and blue color channels.\n    var red = (Math.random () * 512) - 255;\n    var green = (Math.random() * 512) - 255;\n    var blue = (Math.random() * 512) - 255;\n\n    // Create and return a ColorTransform object with the random colors.\n    return new ColorTransform (1, 1, 1, 1, red, green, blue, 0);\n\n}\n\nThis demonstrates how you can create and customize multiple instances of a symbol quickly using code. Each instance is positioned based on the current count within the loop, and each instance is given a random color by setting its transform property (which Circle inherits by extending the MovieClip class).\n"},"using-the-textfield-class/":{"url":"using-the-textfield-class/","title":"Chapter 21: Using the TextField class","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 21: Using the TextField class \nYou can use an instance of the\nTextField class to display\ntext or create a text input field on the screen in OpenFL. The TextField class\nis the basis for other text-based components, such as the TextArea components or\nthe TextInput components in Haxe UI or\nFeathers UI.\nText field content can be pre-specified in Haxe code, loaded from a text file or\ndatabase, or entered by a user interacting with your application. Within a text\nfield, the text can appear as rendered HTML content, with images embedded in the\nrendered HTML. After you create an instance of a text field, you can use\nopenfl.text classes, such as TextFormat and StyleSheet, to control the\nappearance of the text. The\nopenfl.text package contains\nnearly all the classes related to creating, managing, and formatting text in\nOpenFL.\nYou can format text by defining the formatting with a TextFormat object and\nassigning that object to the text field. If your text field contains HTML text,\nyou can apply a StyleSheet object to the text field to assign styles to specific\npieces of the text field content. The TextFormat object or StyleSheet object\ncontains properties defining the appearance of the text, such as color, size,\nand weight. The TextFormat object assigns the properties to all the content\nwithin a text field or to a range of text. For example, within the same text\nfield, one sentence can be bold red text and the next sentence can be blue\nitalic text.\nIn addition to the classes in the\nopenfl.text package, you can\nuse the\nopenfl.events.TextEvent class\nto respond to user actions related to text.\nSection Contents\n\nDisplaying text\nSelecting and manipulating text\nCapturing text input\nRestricting text input\nFormatting text\nAdvanced text rendering\nWorking with static text\n\n"},"using-the-textfield-class/displaying-text.html":{"url":"using-the-textfield-class/displaying-text.html","title":"Displaying text","keywords":"","body":"Displaying text \nThe simplest way to display text programmatically is through a text field.\nTypes of text\nThe type of text within a text field is characterized by its source:\n\nDynamic text\nDynamic text includes content that is loaded from an external source, such as\na text file, an XML file, or even a remote web service.\n\nInput text\nInput text is any text entered by a user or dynamic text that a user can edit.\nYou can set up a style sheet to format input text, or use the\nopenfl.text.TextFormat class to assign properties to the text field for the\ninput content. For more information, see\nCapturing text input.\n\nStatic text\nStatic text is created through SWF assets only. You cannot create a static\ntext instance using Haxe code. However, you can use Haxe classes like\nStaticText and TextSnapshot to manipulate an existing static text instance.\nFor more information, see\nWorking with static text.\n\n\nModifying the text field contents\nYou can define dynamic text by assigning a string to the\nopenfl.text.TextField.text property. You assign a string directly to the\nproperty, as follows:\nmyTextField.text = \"Hello World\";\n\nYou can also assign the text property a value from a variable defined in your\nscript, as in the following example:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.text.*;\n\nclass TextFieldExample extends Sprite\n{\n    private var myTextBox:TextField = new TextField();\n    private var myText:String = \"Hello World\";\n\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        addChild(myTextBox);\n        myTextBox.text = myText;\n    }\n}\n\nAlternatively, you can assign the text property a value from a remote\nvariable. You have multiple options for loading text values from remote sources:\n\nThe openfl.net.URLLoader and openfl.net.URLRequest classes load variables for\nthe text from a local or remote location.\n\nThe openfl.filesystem.File and openfl.filesystem.FileStream classes load text\nfrom the local file system.\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying HTML text\nThe openfl.text.TextField class has an htmlText property that you can use to\nidentify your text string as one containing HTML tags for formatting the\ncontent. As in the following example, you must assign your string value to the\nhtmlText property (not the text property) for OpenFL to render the text as\nHTML:\nvar myText:String = \"This is some content to render as HTML text.\";\nmyTextBox.htmlText = myText;\nOpenFL supports a subset of HTML tags and entities for the htmlText\nproperty. The\nopenfl.text.TextField.htmlText property\ndescription in the OpenFL API Reference provides detailed information about the\nsupported HTML tags and entities.\nOnce you designate your content using the htmlText property, you can use style\nsheets or the textformat tag to manage the formatting of your content. For\nmore information, see Formatting text.\n tags are supported\n## Using images in text fields\n\nAnother advantage to displaying your content as HTML text is that you can\ninclude images in the text field. You can reference an image, local or remote,\nusing the `img` tag and have it appear within the associated text field.\n\nThe following example creates a text field named `myTextBox` and includes a JPG\nimage of an eye, stored in the same directory as the SWF file, within the\ndisplayed text:\n\n```haxe\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.text.*;\n\nclass TextWithImageExample extends Sprite\n{\n    private var myTextBox:TextField;\n    private var myText:String = \"This is some content to test and seewhat can be rendered.You should see an eye image and some HTML text.\";\n\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        myTextBox = new TextField();\n\n        myTextBox.width = 200;\n        myTextBox.height = 200;\n        myTextBox.multiline = true;\n        myTextBox.wordWrap = true;\n        myTextBox.border = true;\n\n        addChild(myTextBox);\n        myTextBox.htmlText = myText;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `img` tag supports JPEG, GIF, and PNG files.-->\nScrolling text in a text field\nIn many cases, your text can be longer than the text field displaying the text.\nOr you may have an input field that allows a user to input more text than can be\ndisplayed at one time. You can use the scroll-related properties of the\nopenfl.text.TextField class to manage lengthy content, either vertically or\nhorizontally.\nThe scroll-related properties include TextField.scrollV, TextField.scrollH\nand maxScrollV and maxScrollH. Use these properties to respond to events,\nlike a mouse click or a keypress.\nThe following example creates a text field that is a set size and contains more\ntext than the field can display at one time. As the user clicks the text field,\nthe text scrolls vertically.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.text.*;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass TextScrollExample extends Sprite\n{\n    private var myTextBox:TextField = new TextField();\n    private var myText:String = \"Hello world and welcome to the show.

You can also set the TextField defaultTextFormat\nproperty to specify the format to be used for user-entered text.\nApplying cascading style sheets\nText fields can contain either plain text or HTML-formatted text. Plain text is\nstored in the text property of the instance, and HTML text is stored in the\nhtmlText property.\nYou can use CSS style declarations to define text styles that you can apply to\nmany different text fields. CSS style declarations can be created in your\napplication code or loaded in at run time from an external CSS file.\nThe openfl.text.StyleSheet class handles CSS styles. The StyleSheet class\nrecognizes a limited set of CSS properties. For a detailed list of the style\nproperties that the StyleSheet class supports, see the\nopenfl.text.Stylesheet class\nin the OpenFL API Reference.\nAs the following example shows, you can create CSS in your code and apply those\nstyles to HTML text by using a StyleSheet object:\nvar style:StyleSheet = new StyleSheet();\n\nvar styleObj:Object = new Object();\nstyleObj.fontSize = \"bold\";\nstyleObj.color = \"#FF0000\";\nstyle.setStyle(\".darkRed\", styleObj);\n\nvar tf:TextField = new TextField();\ntf.styleSheet = style;\ntf.htmlText = \"Red apple\";\n\naddChild(tf);\n\nAfter creating a StyleSheet object, the example code creates a simple object to\nhold a set of style declaration properties. Then it calls the\nStyleSheet.setStyle() method, which adds the new style to the style sheet with\nthe name \".darkred\". Next, it applies the style sheet formatting by assigning\nthe StyleSheet object to the TextField styleSheet property.\nFor CSS styles to take effect, the style sheet should be applied to the\nTextField object before the htmlText property is set.\nBy design, a text field with a style sheet is not editable. If you have an input\ntext field and assign a style sheet to it, the text field shows the properties\nof the style sheet, but the text field does not allow users to enter new text\ninto it. Also, you cannot use the following OpenFL APIs on a text field with an\nassigned style sheet:\n\nThe TextField.replaceText() method\n\nThe TextField.replaceSelectedText() method\n\nThe TextField.defaultTextFormat property\n\nThe TextField.setTextFormat() method\n\n\nIf a text field has a style sheet assigned to it, but later the\nTextField.styleSheet property is set to null, the contents of both\nTextField.text and TextField.htmlText properties add tags and attributes to\ntheir content to incorporate the formatting from the previously assigned style\nsheet. To preserve the original htmlText property, save it in a variable\nbefore setting the style sheet to null.\nLoading an external CSS file\nThe CSS approach to formatting is more powerful when you can load CSS\ninformation from an external file at run time. When the CSS data is external to\nthe application itself, you can change the visual style of text in your\napplication without having to change your Haxe source code. After your\napplication has been deployed, you can change an external CSS file to change the\nlook of the application, without having to redeploy the application SWF file.\nThe StyleSheet.parseCSS() method converts a string that contains CSS data into\nstyle declarations in the StyleSheet object. The following example shows how to\nread an external CSS file and apply its style declarations to a TextField\nobject.\nFirst, here is the content of the CSS file to be loaded, which is named\nexample.css:\np {\n  font-family: Times New Roman, Times, _serif;\n  font-size: 14;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, _sans;\n  font-size: 20;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.bluetext {\n  color: #0000cc;\n}\n\nNext is the Haxe code for a class that loads the example.css file and applies\nthe styles to TextField content:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoader;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\nimport openfl.text.StyleSheet;\nimport openfl.text.TextField;\nimport openfl.text.TextFieldAutoSize;\n\nclass CSSFormattingExample extends Sprite\n{\n    var loader:URLLoader;\n    var field:TextField;\n    var exampleText:String = \"This is a headline\" +\n        \"This is a line of text. \" +\n        \"This line of text is colored blue.\";\n\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        field = new TextField();\n        field.width = 300;\n        field.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT;\n        field.wordWrap = true;\n        addChild(field);\n\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"example.css\");\n\n        loader = new URLLoader();\n        loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onCSSFileLoaded);\n        loader.load(req);\n    }\n\n    function onCSSFileLoaded(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var sheet:StyleSheet = new StyleSheet();\n        sheet.parseCSS(loader.data);\n        field.styleSheet = sheet;\n        field.htmlText = exampleText;\n    }\n}\n\nWhen the CSS data is loaded, the onCSSFileLoaded() method executes and calls\nthe StyleSheet.parseCSS() method to transfer the style declarations to the\nStyleSheet object.\nFormatting ranges of text within a text field\nA useful method of the openfl.text.TextField class is the setTextFormat()\nmethod. Using setTextFormat(), you can assign specific properties to the\ncontents of a part of a text field to respond to user input, such as forms that\nneed to remind users that certain entries are required or to change the emphasis\nof a subsection of a passage of text within a text field as a user selects parts\nof the text.\nThe following example uses TextField.setTextFormat() on a range of characters\nto change the appearance of part of the content of myTextField when the user\nclicks the text field:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.text.*;\n\nclass FormattingRangesExample extends Sprite {\n    private var myTextField:TextField;\n    private var myformat:TextFormat;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        myTextField = new TextField();\n        myTextField.text = \"No matter where you click on this text field the TEXT IN ALL CAPS changes format.\";\n        myTextField.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT;\n        addChild(myTextField);\n        addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, changeText);\n\n        myformat = new TextFormat();\n        myformat.color = 0xFF0000;\n        myformat.size = 18;\n        myformat.underline = true;\n    }\n\n    function changeText(event:MouseEvent):Void\n    {\n        myTextField.setTextFormat(myformat, 49, 65);\n    }\n}\n\n"},"using-the-textfield-class/advanced-text-rendering.html":{"url":"using-the-textfield-class/advanced-text-rendering.html","title":"Advanced text rendering","keywords":"","body":"Advanced text rendering\nOpenFL provides a variety of classes in the openfl.text package to control the\nproperties of displayed text, including embedded fonts, anti-aliasing settings,\nalpha channel control, and other specific settings.

When\nspecifying an embedded font, the fontFamily property should only contain a\nsingle name; it cannot use a comma-delimited list of multiple font names.\n\nIf using CSS styles to set fonts for TextFields or components, set the\nfont-family CSS property to the name of the embedded font.

You cannot programmatically instantiate static text using Haxe\ncode. Static text is useful if the text is short and is not intended to change\n(as dynamic text can). Think of static text as similar to a graphic element like\na circle or square drawn on the Stage in Adobe Animate. While static text is\nmore limited than dynamic text, OpenFL does allow you to read the property\nvalues of static text using the StaticText class.\n\nAccessing static text fields with the StaticText class\nTypically, you use the openfl.text.StaticText class to interact with a static\ntext instance placed on the Stage. You can't instantiate a static text instance\nprogrammatically. Static text is created in Adobe Animate.\nTo create a reference to an existing static text field, iterate over the items\nin the display list and assign a variable. For example:\nfor (i in 0...this.numChildren; i++) {\n    var displayitem:DisplayObject = this.getChildAt(i);\n    if (Std.isOfType(displayitem, StaticText)) {\n        trace(\"a static text field is item \" + i + \" on the display list\");\n        var myFieldLabel:StaticText = cast(displayitem, StaticText);\n        trace(\"and contains the text: \" + myFieldLabel.text);\n    }\n}\n\nOnce you have a reference to a static text field, you can use the properties of\nthat text field in Haxe. The following code assumes that a variable named\nmyFieldLabel is assigned to a static text reference. A dynamic text field\nnamed myField is positioned relative to the x and y values of\nmyFieldLabel and displays the value of myFieldLabel again.\nvar myField:TextField = new TextField();\naddChild(myField);\nmyField.x = myFieldLabel.x;\nmyField.y = myFieldLabel.y + 20;\nmyField.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT;\nmyField.text = \"and \" + myFieldLabel.text\n\n\nUsing the TextSnapshot class\nIf you want to programmatically work with an existing static text instance, you\ncan use the openfl.text.TextSnapshot class to work with the textSnapshot\nproperty of a openfl.display.DisplayObjectContainer. In other words, you create a\nTextSnapshot instance from the DisplayObjectContainer.textSnapshot property.\nYou can then apply methods to that instance to retrieve values or select parts\nof the static text.\nFor example, place a static text field that contains the text \"TextSnapshot\nExample\" on the Stage. Add the following Haxe code:\nvar mySnap:TextSnapshot = this.textSnapshot;\nvar count:Number = mySnap.charCount;\nmySnap.setSelected(0, 4, true);\nmySnap.setSelected(1, 2, false);\nvar myText:String = mySnap.getSelectedText(false);\ntrace(myText);\n\nThe TextSnapshot class is useful for getting the text out of static text fields\nin a loaded SWF file, if you want to use the text as a value in another part of\nan application.\n"},"working-with-sound/":{"url":"working-with-sound/","title":"Chapter 24: Working with sound","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 24: Working with sound \nOpenFL is made for immersive, interactive applications—and one often overlooked\nelement of powerfully immersive applications is sound.

You can\nplay back sound using OpenFL and Haxe.\nWhen sound data is converted to digital form, it has various characteristics,\nsuch as the sound's volume and whether it is stereo or mono sound. When you play\nback a sound in OpenFL, you can adjust these characteristics as well—make the\nsound louder, or make it seem to be coming from a certain direction, for\ninstance.\nBefore you can control a sound in Haxe, you need to have the sound information\nloaded. There are five ways you can get audio data into OpenFL so that you can\nwork with it using Haxe.\n\nLoad an external sound file such (as mp3, ogg, or wav) from a URL or the file\nsystem.\n\nEmbed the sound information as an asset into an OpenFL project at build time.\n\n\n\n\nStream audio from a server.\n\nDynamically generate and play audio.\n\n\nWhen you load sound data from an external sound file, you can begin playing back\nthe start of the sound file while the rest of the sound data is still loading.\nAlthough there are various sound file formats used to encode digital audio,\nOpenFL supports sound files that are stored in the MP3, Ogg Vorbis, or WAV\nformats (but certain formats are available only on specific target platforms).\nThey cannot directly load or play sound files in other formats, like AAC or\nAIFF.\nWhile you're working with sound in OpenFL, you'll likely work with several\nclasses from the\nopenfl.media package. The\nSound class is the class you\nuse to get access to audio information by loading a sound file or assigning a\nfunction to an event that samples sound data and then starting playback. Once\nyou start playing a sound, OpenFL gives you access to a\nSoundChannel object.\nSince an audio file that you've loaded may only be one of several sounds that\nyou play on a user's computer, each individual sound that's playing uses its own\nSoundChannel object; the combined output of all the SoundChannel objects mixed\ntogether is what actually plays over the computer's speakers. You use this\nSoundChannel instance to control properties of the sound and to stop its\nplayback. Finally, if you want to control the combined audio, the SoundMixer\nclass gives you control over the mixed output.\nYou can also use several other classes to perform more specific tasks when\nyou're working with sound in OpenFL; for more information on all the\nsound-related classes, see\nUnderstanding the sound architecture.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you may encounter:\nAmplitudeThe distance of a point on the sound waveform from the zero or equilibrium line.\nBit rateThe amount of data that is encoded or streamed for each second of a sound file.\nFor mp3 files, the bit rate is usually stated in terms of thousands of bits per\nsecond (kbps). A higher bit rate generally means a higher quality sound wave.\nBufferingThe receiving and storing of sound data before it is played back.\nmp3MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, or mp3, is a popular sound compression format.\noggOgg Vorbis is a popular sound compression format.\nwavWaveform Audio File Format, or wav, is a popular uncompressed sound format.\nPanningThe positioning of an audio signal between the left and right channels in a\nstereo soundfield.\nPeakThe highest point in a waveform.\nSampling rateDefines the number of samples per second taken from an analog audio signal to\nmake a digital signal. The sampling rate of standard compact disc audio is 44.1\nkHz or 44,100 samples per second.\nStreamingThe process of playing the early portions of a sound file or video file while\nlater portions of that file are still being loaded from a server.\nVolumeThe loudness of a sound.\nWaveformThe shape of a graph of the varying amplitudes of a sound signal over time.\n"},"working-with-sound/understanding-the-sound-architecture.html":{"url":"working-with-sound/understanding-the-sound-architecture.html","title":"Understanding the sound architecture","keywords":"","body":"Understanding the sound architecture \nYour applications can load sound data from five main sources:\n\nExternal sound files loaded at run time\n\nSound resources embedded as assets within the application\n\n\n\n\n\nSound data being generated dynamically through the use of the sampleData\nevent handler\n\nSound data can be fully loaded before it is played back, or it can be streamed,\nmeaning that it is played back while it is still loading.\nThe OpenFL sound classes support sound files that are stored in the mp3, ogg, or\nwav formats.

An\napplication can't reuse a Sound object to load more than one sound. If it wants\nto load a new sound resource, it should create a new Sound object.\nIf you are loading a small sound file, such as a click sound to be attached to a\nbutton, your application can create a new Sound and have it automatically load\nthe sound file, as shown below:\nvar req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"click.mp3\");\nvar s:Sound = new Sound(req);\n\nThe Sound() constructor accepts a URLRequest object as its first parameter.\nWhen a value for the URLRequest parameter is supplied, the new Sound object\nstarts loading the specified sound resource automatically.\nIn all but the simplest cases, your application should pay attention to the\nsound's loading progress and watch for errors during loading. For example, if\nthe click sound is fairly large, it might not be completely loaded by the time\nthe user clicks the button that triggers the sound. Trying to play an unloaded\nsound could cause a run-time error. It's safer to wait for the sound to load\ncompletely before letting users take actions that might start sounds playing.\nA Sound object dispatches a number of different events during the sound loading\nprocess. Your application can listen for these events to track loading progress\nand make sure that the sound loads completely before playing. The following\ntable lists the events that can be dispatched by a Sound object.\n\n\n\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nopen (Event.OPEN)\nDispatched right before the sound loading operation begins.\n\n\nprogress (ProgressEvent.PROGRESS)\nDispatched periodically during the sound loading process when data is received from the file or stream.\n\n\nid3 (Event.ID3)\nDispatched when ID3 data is available for an mp3 sound.\n\n\ncomplete (Event.COMPLETE)\nDispatched when all of the sound resource's data has been loaded.\n\n\nioError (IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR)\nDispatched when a sound file cannot be located or when the loading process is interrupted before all sound data can be received.\n\n\n\nThe following code illustrates how to play a sound after it has finished\nloading:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass LoadAndPlaySoundExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var s:Sound = new Sound();\n        s.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onSoundLoaded);\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        s.load(req);\n    }\n\n    function onSoundLoaded(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var localSound:Sound = cast(event.target, Sound);\n        localSound.play();\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, the code sample creates a new Sound object without giving it an initial\nvalue for the URLRequest parameter. Then, it listens for the Event.COMPLETE\nevent from the Sound object, which causes the onSoundLoaded() method to\nexecute when all the sound data is loaded. Next, it calls the Sound.load()\nmethod with a new URLRequest value for the sound file.\nThe onSoundLoaded() method executes when the sound loading is complete. The\ntarget property of the Event object is a reference to the Sound object.\nCalling the play() method of the Sound object then starts the sound playback.\nMonitoring the sound loading process\nSound files can be very large and take a long time to load. While OpenFL lets\nyour application play sounds even before they are fully loaded, you might want\nto give the user an indication of how much of the sound data has been loaded and\nhow much of the sound has already been played.\nThe Sound class dispatches two events that make it relatively easy to display\nthe loading progress of a sound: ProgressEvent.PROGRESS and Event.COMPLETE.\nThe following example shows how to use these events to display progress\ninformation about the sound being loaded:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.events.IOErrorEvent;\nimport openfl.events.ProgressEvent;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass SoundLoadProgressExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var s:Sound = new Sound();\n        s.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onLoadProgress);\n        s.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onLoadComplete);\n        s.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, onIOError);\n\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        s.load(req);\n    }\n\n    function onLoadProgress(event:ProgressEvent):Void\n    {\n        var loadedPct = Math.round(100 * (event.bytesLoaded / event.bytesTotal));\n        trace(\"The sound is \" + loadedPct + \"% loaded.\");\n    }\n\n    function onLoadComplete(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var localSound:Sound = cast(event.target, Sound);\n        localSound.play();\n    }\n\n    function onIOError(event:IOErrorEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"The sound could not be loaded: \" + event.text);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code first creates a Sound object and then adds listeners to that object\nfor the ProgressEvent.PROGRESS and Event.COMPLETE events. After the\nSound.load() method has been called and the first data is received from the\nsound file, a ProgressEvent.PROGRESS event occurs and triggers the\nonSoundLoadProgress() method.\nThe percentage of the sound data that has been loaded is equal to the value of\nthe bytesLoaded property of the ProgressEvent object divided by the value of\nthe bytesTotal property. The same bytesLoaded and bytesTotal properties\nare available on the Sound object as well. The example above simply shows\nmessages about the sound loading progress, but you can easily use the\nbytesLoaded and bytesTotal values to update progress bar components, such as\nthe ones that come with libraries like Haxe UI or\nFeathers UI.\nThis example also shows how an application can recognize and respond to an error\nwhen loading sound files. For example, if a sound file with the given filename\ncannot be located, an Event.IO_ERROR event is dispatched by the Sound object.\nIn the previous code, the onIOError() method executes and displays a brief\nerror message when an error occurs.\n"},"working-with-sound/working-with-sound-assets.html":{"url":"working-with-sound/working-with-sound-assets.html","title":"Working with sound assets","keywords":"","body":"Working with sound assets \nUsing sound assets, instead of loading sounds from a web URL or a file system\npath, is another possibility for playing audio.

You can generate audio data when you assign an event listener for\nthe sampleData event of a Sound object. (The sampleData event is defined in\nthe SampleDataEvent class in the\nopenfl.events package.) In\nthis environment, the Sound object doesn't load sound data from a file. Instead,\nit acts as a socket for sound data that is being streamed to it through the use\nof the function you assign to this event.\nWhen you add a sampleData event listener to a Sound object, the object\nperiodically requests data to add to the sound buffer. This buffer contains data\nfor the Sound object to play. When you call the play() method of the Sound\nobject, it dispatches the sampleData event when requesting new sound data.\n(This is true only when the Sound object has not loaded mp3, ogg, or wav data\nfrom a file.)\nThe SampleDataEvent object includes a data property. In your event listener,\nyou write ByteArray objects to this data object. The byte arrays you write to\nthis object add to buffered sound data that the Sound object plays. The byte\narray in the buffer is a stream of floating-point values from -1 to 1. Each\nfloating-point value represents the amplitude of one channel (left or right) of\na sound sample. Sound is sampled at 44,100 samples per second. Each sample\ncontains a left and right channel, interleaved as floating-point data in the\nbyte array.\nIn your handler function, you use the ByteArray.writeFloat() method to write\nto the data property of the sampleData event. For example, the following\ncode generates a sine wave:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.SampleDataEvent;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\n\nclass SineWaveSample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var mySound:Sound = new Sound();\n        mySound.addEventListener(SampleDataEvent.SAMPLE_DATA, sineWaveGenerator);\n        mySound.play();\n    }\n\n    function sineWaveGenerator(event:SampleDataEvent):Void\n    {\n        for (i in 0...8192)\n        {\n            var n = Math.sin((i + event.position) / Math.PI / 4);\n            event.data.writeFloat(n);\n            event.data.writeFloat(n);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen you call Sound.play(), the application starts calling your event handler,\nrequesting sound sample data. The application continues to send events as the\nsound plays back until you stop providing data, or until you call\nSoundChannel.stop().\nThe latency of the event varies from platform to platform, and could change in\nfuture versions of OpenFL. Do not depend on a specific latency; calculate it\ninstead. To calculate the latency, use the following formula:\n(SampleDataEvent.position / 44.1) - SoundChannelObject.position\nProvide from 2048 through 8192 samples to the data property of the\nSampleDataEvent object (for each call to the event listener). For best\nperformance, provide as many samples as possible (up to 8192). The fewer samples\nyou provide, the more likely it is that clicks and pops will occur during\nplayback. This behavior can differ on various platforms and can occur in various\nsituations—for example, when resizing the browser. Code that works on one\nplatform when you provide only 2048 sample might not work as well when run on a\ndifferent platform. If you require the lowest latency possible, consider making\nthe amount of data user-selectable.\nIf you provide fewer than 2048 samples (per call to the sampleData event\nlistener), the application stops after playing the remaining samples.

See\nMDN: Autoplay guide for media and Web Audio APIs\nfor more details.\n\nWhen playing back sounds using OpenFL, you can perform the following operations:\n\nPlay a sound from a specific starting position\n\nPause a sound and resume playback from the same position later\n\nKnow exactly when a sound finishes playing\n\nTrack the playback progress of a sound\n\nChange volume or panning while a sound plays\n\n\nTo perform these operations during playback, use the SoundChannel and\nSoundTransform classes.\nThe SoundChannel class controls the playback of a single sound. The\nSoundChannel.position property can be thought of as a playhead, indicating the\ncurrent point in the sound data that's being played.\nWhen an application calls the Sound.play() method, a new instance of the\nSoundChannel class is created to control the playback.\nYour application can play a sound from a specific starting position by passing\nthat position, in terms of milliseconds, as the startTime parameter of the\nSound.play() method. It can also specify a fixed number of times to repeat the\nsound in rapid succession by passing a numeric value in the loops parameter of\nthe Sound.play() method.\nWhen the Sound.play() method is called with both a startTime parameter and a\nloops parameter, the sound is played back repeatedly from the same starting\npoint each time, as shown in the following code:\nvar snd:Sound = new Sound(new URLRequest(\"repeatingSound.mp3\"));\nsnd.play(1000, 3);\n\nIn this example, the sound is played from a point one second after the start of\nthe sound, three times in succession.\nPausing and resuming a sound\nIf your application plays long sounds, like songs or podcasts, you probably want\nto let users pause and resume the playback of those sounds. A sound cannot\nliterally be paused during playback in OpenFL; it can only be stopped. However,\na sound can be played starting from any point. You can record the position of\nthe sound at the time it was stopped, and then replay the sound starting at that\nposition later.\nFor example, let's say your code loads and plays a sound file like this:\nvar snd:Sound = new Sound(new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\"));\nvar channel:SoundChannel = snd.play();\n\nWhile the sound plays, the SoundChannel.position property indicates the point\nin the sound file that is currently being played. Your application can store the\nposition value before stopping the sound from playing, as follows:\nvar pausePosition = channel.position;\nchannel.stop();\n\nTo resume playing the sound, pass the previously stored position value to\nrestart the sound from the same point it stopped at before.\nchannel = snd.play(pausePosition);\n\nMonitoring playback\nYour application might want to know when a sound stops playing so it can start\nplaying another sound, or clean up some resources used during the previous\nplayback. The SoundChannel class dispatches an Event.SOUND_COMPLETE event when\nits sound finishes playing. Your application can listen for this event and take\nappropriate action, as shown below:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.media.SoundChannel;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass SoundCompleteEventExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var snd:Sound = new Sound();\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"smallSound.mp3\");\n        snd.load(req);\n\n        var channel:SoundChannel = snd.play();\n        channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlaybackComplete);\n    }\n\n    function onPlaybackComplete(event:Event):Void {\n        trace(\"The sound has finished playing.\");\n    }\n}\n\nThe SoundChannel class does not dispatch progress events during playback. To\nreport on playback progress, your application can set up its own timing\nmechanism and track the position of the sound playhead.\nTo calculate what percentage of a sound has been played, you can divide the\nvalue of the SoundChannel.position property by the length of the sound data\nthat's being played:\nvar playbackPercent = 100.0 * (channel.position / snd.length);\n\nHowever, this code only reports accurate playback percentages if the sound data\nwas fully loaded before playback began. The Sound.length property shows the\nsize of the sound data that is currently loaded, not the eventual size of the\nentire sound file. To track the playback progress of a streaming sound that is\nstill loading, your application should estimate the eventual size of the full\nsound file and use that value in its calculations. You can estimate the eventual\nlength of the sound data using the bytesLoaded and bytesTotal properties of\nthe Sound object, as follows:\nvar estimatedLength = Math.ceil(snd.length / (snd.bytesLoaded / snd.bytesTotal));\nvar playbackPercent = 100.0 * (channel.position / estimatedLength);\n\nThe following code loads a larger sound file and uses the Event.ENTER_FRAME\nevent as its timing mechanism for showing playback progress. It periodically\nreports on the playback percentage, which is calculated as the current position\nvalue divided by the total length of the sound data:\nimport openfl.media.SoundChannel;\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass SoundProgressEventExample extends Sprite {\n    private var snd:Sound;\n    private var channel:SoundChannel;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        snd = new Sound();\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        snd.load(req);\n\n        channel = snd.play();\n        addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n        channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlaybackComplete);\n    }\n\n    function onEnterFrame(event:Event):Void {\n        var estimatedLength:Int = Math.ceil(snd.length / (snd.bytesLoaded / snd.bytesTotal));\n        var playbackPercent:Int = Math.round(100 * (channel.position / estimatedLength));\n        trace(\"Sound playback is \" + playbackPercent + \"% complete.\");\n    }\n\n    function onPlaybackComplete(event:Event):Void {\n        trace(\"The sound has finished playing.\");\n        removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n    }\n}\n\nAfter the sound data starts loading, this code calls the snd.play() method and\nstores the resulting SoundChannel object in the channel variable. Then it adds\nan event listener to the main application for the Event.ENTER_FRAME event and\nanother event listener to the SoundChannel object for the Event.SOUND_COMPLETE\nevent that occurs when playback is complete.\nEach time the application reaches a new frame in its animation, the\nonEnterFrame() method is called. The onEnterFrame() method estimates the\ntotal length of the sound file based on the amount of data that has already been\nloaded, and then it calculates and displays the current playback percentage.\nWhen the entire sound has been played, the onPlaybackComplete() method\nexecutes, removing the event listener for the Event.ENTER_FRAME event so that\nit doesn't try to display progress updates after playback is done.\nThe Event.ENTER_FRAME event can be dispatched many times per second. In some\ncases, you won't want to display playback progress that frequently. In those\ncases, your application can set up its own timing mechanism using the\nopenfl.utils.Timer class.\nStopping streaming sounds\nThere is a quirk in the playback process for sounds that are streaming—that is,\nfor sounds that are still loading while they are being played. When your\napplication calls the SoundChannel.stop() method on a SoundChannel instance\nthat is playing back a streaming sound, the sound playback stops for one frame,\nand then on the next frame, it restarts from the beginning of the sound. This\noccurs because the sound loading process is still underway. To stop both the\nloading and the playback of a streaming sound, call the Sound.close() method.\n"},"working-with-sound/controlling-sound-volume-and-panning.html":{"url":"working-with-sound/controlling-sound-volume-and-panning.html","title":"Controlling sound volume and panning","keywords":"","body":"Controlling sound volume and panning \nAn individual\nSoundChannel object\ncontrols both the left and the right stereo channels for a sound. If a sound is\nmonaural, the left and right stereo channels of the SoundChannel object will\ncontain identical waveforms.\nYou can find out the amplitude of each stereo channel of the sound being played\nusing the leftPeak and rightPeak properties of the SoundChannel object.\nThese properties show the peak amplitude of the sound waveform itself. They do\nnot represent the actual playback volume. The actual playback volume is a\nfunction of the amplitude of the sound wave and the volume values set in the\nSoundChannel object.\n\nThe pan property of a SoundChannel object can be used to specify a different\nvolume level for each of the left and right channels during playback. The pan\nproperty can have a value ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 means the left channel\nplays at top volume while the right channel is silent, and 1 means the right\nchannel plays at top volume while the left channel is silent. Numeric values in\nbetween -1 and 1 set proportional values for the left and right channel values,\nand a value of 0 means that both channels play at a balanced, mid-volume level.\nThe following code example creates a SoundTransform object with a volume value\nof 0.6 and a pan value of -1 (top left channel volume and no right channel\nvolume). It passes the SoundTransform object as a parameter to the play()\nmethod, which applies that SoundTransform object to the new SoundChannel object\nthat is created to control the playback.\nvar snd:Sound = new Sound(new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\"));\nvar trans:SoundTransform = new SoundTransform(0.6, -1);\nvar channel:SoundChannel = snd.play(0, 1, trans);\n\nYou can alter the volume and panning while a sound is playing by setting the\npan or volume properties of a SoundTransform object and then applying that\nobject as the soundTransform property of a SoundChannel object.\n\n\nThe following example alternates the panning of the sound from the left channel\nto the right channel and back while the sound plays.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.media.SoundChannel;\nimport openfl.media.SoundTransform;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass PanningSoundExample extends Sprite {\n    private var trans:SoundTransform;\n    private var channel:SoundChannel;\n    private var panCounter:Float = 0;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var snd:Sound = new Sound();\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        snd.load(req);\n\n        trans = new SoundTransform(1, 0);\n        channel = snd.play(0, 1, trans);\n        channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlaybackComplete);\n\n        addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n    }\n\n    function onEnterFrame(event:Event):Void {\n        trans.pan = Math.sin(panCounter);\n        channel.soundTransform = trans;\n        panCounter += 0.05;\n    }\n\n    function onPlaybackComplete(event:Event):Void {\n        removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code starts by loading a sound file and then creating a new SoundTransform\nobject with volume set to 1 (full volume) and pan set to 0 (evenly balanced\nbetween left and right). Then it calls the snd.play() method, passing the\nSoundTransform object as a parameter.\nWhile the sound plays, the onEnterFrame() method executes repeatedly. The\nonEnterFrame() method uses the Math.sin() function to generate a value\nbetween -1 and 1, a range that corresponds to the acceptable values of the\nSoundTransform.pan property. The SoundTransform object's pan property is set\nto the new value, and then the channel's soundTransform property is set to use\nthe altered SoundTransform object.\nTo run this example, replace the filename bigSound.mp3 with the name of a local\nmp3 file. Then run the example. You should hear the left channel volume getting\nlouder while the right channel volume gets softer, and vice versa.\n\n"},"keyboard-input/":{"url":"keyboard-input/","title":"Chapter 30: Keyboard input","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 30: Keyboard input \nYour application can capture and respond to keyboard input.

For example, you\ncan place an event listener on the Stage to listen for and respond to keyboard\ninput. In the following code, an event listener captures a key press, and the\nkey name and key code properties are displayed:\nfunction reportKeyDown(event:KeyboardEvent):Void\n{\n    trace(\"Key Pressed: \" + String.fromCharCode(event.charCode) +\n        \" (character code: \" + event.charCode + \")\");\n}\nstage.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, reportKeyDown);\n\nSome keys, such as the Ctrl key, generate events even though they have no glyph\nrepresentation.\nIn the previous code example, the keyboard event listener captured keyboard\ninput for the entire Stage. You can also write an event listener for a specific\ndisplay object on the Stage; this event listener is triggered when the object\nhas the focus.\nIn the following example, keystrokes are reflected in the Output panel only when\nthe user types inside the TextField instance. Holding the Shift key down\ntemporarily changes the border color of the TextField to red.\nThis code assumes there is a TextField instance named tf on the Stage.\ntf.border = true;\ntf.type = TextFieldType.INPUT;\ntf.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, reportKeyDown);\ntf.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_UP, reportKeyUp);\n\nfunction reportKeyDown(event:KeyboardEvent):Void\n{\n    trace(\"Key Pressed: \" + String.fromCharCode(event.charCode) + \" (key code: \" + event.keyCode + \" character code: \" + event.charCode + \")\");\n    if (event.keyCode == Keyboard.SHIFT) tf.borderColor = 0xFF0000;\n}\n\nfunction reportKeyUp(event:KeyboardEvent):Void\n{\n    trace(\"Key Released: \" + String.fromCharCode(event.charCode) + \" (key code: \" + event.keyCode + \" character code: \" + event.charCode + \")\");\n    if (event.keyCode == Keyboard.SHIFT)\n    {\n        tf.borderColor = 0x000000;\n    }\n}\n\nThe TextField class also reports a textInput event that you can listen for\nwhen a user enters text. For more information, see\nCapturing text input.\nNote: On some targets, a keyboard event can be canceled, but certain targets may\nnot allow it.\nKey codes and character codes\nYou can access the keyCode and charCode properties of a keyboard event to\ndetermine what key was pressed and then trigger other actions. The keyCode\nproperty is a numeric value that corresponds to the value of a key on the\nkeyboard. The charCode property is the numeric value of that key in the\ncurrent character set. (The default character set is UTF-8, which supports\nASCII.)\nThe primary difference between the key code and character values is that a key\ncode value represents a particular key on the keyboard (the 1 on a keypad is\ndifferent than the 1 in the top row, but the key that generates \"1\" and the key\nthat generates \"!\" are the same key) and the character value represents a\nparticular character (the R and r characters are different).\nNote: For the mappings between keys and their character code values in ASCII,\nsee the openfl.ui.Keyboard\nclass listing in the OpenFL API Reference.\nThe mappings between keys and their key codes is dependent on the device and the\noperating system. For this reason, you should not use key mappings to trigger\nactions. Instead, you should use the predefined constant values provided by the\nKeyboard class to reference the appropriate keyCode properties. For example,\ninstead of using the key mapping for the Shift key, use the Keyboard.SHIFT\nconstant (as shown in the preceding code sample).\nKeyboardEvent precedence\nAs with other events, the keyboard event sequence is determined by the display\nobject hierarchy and not the order in which addEventListener() methods are\nassigned in code.\nFor example, suppose you place a text field called tf inside a sprite called\ncontainer and add an event listener for a keyboard event to both instances, as\nthe following example shows:\n\nimport openfl.events.KeyboardEvent;\nimport openfl.text.TextField;\nimport openfl.text.TextFieldType;\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\n\nclass KeyEventPrecedence extends Sprite {\n    private var container:Sprite;\n    private var tf:TextField;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var container = new Sprite();\n        container.name = \"container\"\n        addChild(container);\n\n        var tf = new TextField();\n        tf.name = \"tf\"\n        tf.border = true;\n        tf.type = TextFieldType.INPUT;\n        tf.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, reportKeyDown);\n        container.addChild(tf);\n\n        container.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, reportKeyDown);\n    }\n\n    function reportKeyDown(event:KeyboardEvent):Void {\n        trace(event.currentTarget.name + \" hears key press: \" + String.fromCharCode(event.charCode) + \" (key code: \" + event.keyCode + \" character code: \"\n            + event.charCode + \")\");\n    }\n}\n\nBecause there is a listener on both the text field and its parent container, the\nreportKeyDown() function is called twice for every keystroke inside the\nTextField. Note that for each key pressed, the text field dispatches an event\nbefore the container movie clip dispatches an event.\nThe operating system and the web browser will process keyboard events before\nOpenFL. For example, pressing a keyboard shortcut to close a browser window\n(typically, Ctrl+W or Cmd+W) will be\nhanndled the browser before any OpenFL code dispatches a keyboard event.\n"},"mouse-input/":{"url":"mouse-input/","title":"Chapter 31: Mouse input","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 31: Mouse input \nYour application can create interactivity by capturing and responding to mouse\ninput.

You can add an event listener to the Stage to listen for mouse\nevents that occur anywhere within OpenFL. You can also add event listeners to\nobjects on the Stage that inherit from InteractiveObject (for example, Sprite or\nMovieClip); these listeners are triggered when the object is clicked.\nAs with keyboard events, mouse events bubble. In the following example, because\nsquare is a child of the Stage, the event dispatches both from the sprite\nsquare as well as from the Stage object when the square is clicked:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass BubblingExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var square:Sprite = new Sprite();\n        square.graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000);\n        square.graphics.drawRect(0,0,100,100);\n        square.graphics.endFill();\n        square.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, reportClick);\n        square.x =\n        square.y = 50;\n        addChild(square);\n\n        stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, reportClick);\n    }\n\n    function reportClick(event:MouseEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(event.currentTarget.toString() + \" dispatches MouseEvent. Local coords [\" + event.localX + \",\" + event.localY + \"] Stage coords [\" + event.stageX + \",\" + event.stageY + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n\nIn the previous example, notice that the mouse event contains positional\ninformation about the click. The localX and localY properties contain the\nlocation of the click on the lowest child in the display chain. For example,\nclicking at the top-left corner of square reports local coordinates of [0,0]\nbecause that is the registration point of square. Alternatively, the stageX\nand stageY properties refer to the global coordinates of the click on the\nStage. The same click reports [50,50] for these coordinates, because square\nwas moved to these coordinates. Both of these coordinate pairs can be useful\ndepending on how you want to respond to user interaction.\n\nThe MouseEvent object also contains altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey boolean\nproperties. You can use these properties to check if the Alt, Ctrl, or Shift key\nis also being pressed at the time of the mouse click.\nDragging Sprites around the stage\nYou can allow users to drag a Sprite object around the stage using the\nstartDrag() method of the Sprite class. The following code shows an example of\nthis:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass StartDragExample extends Sprite {\n    private var circle:Sprite;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        circle = new Sprite();\n        circle.graphics.beginFill(0xFFCC00);\n        circle.graphics.drawCircle(0, 0, 40);\n\n        var target1:Sprite = new Sprite();\n        target1.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\n        target1.graphics.drawRect(0, 0, 100, 100);\n        target1.name = \"target1\";\n\n        var target2:Sprite = new Sprite();\n        target2.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);\n        target2.graphics.drawRect(0, 200, 100, 100);\n        target2.name = \"target2\";\n\n        addChild(target1);\n        addChild(target2);\n        addChild(circle);\n\n        circle.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, mouseDown);\n        circle.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, mouseReleased);\n    }\n\n    function mouseDown(event:MouseEvent):Void\n    {\n        circle.startDrag();\n    }\n\n    function mouseReleased(event:MouseEvent):Void\n    {\n        circle.stopDrag();\n        trace(circle.dropTarget.name);\n    }\n}\n\nFor more details, see the section on creating mouse drag interaction in\nChanging position.\n\nCustomizing the mouse cursor\nThe mouse cursor (mouse pointer) can be hidden or swapped for any display object\non the Stage.

The\nfollowing example illustrates a basic execution of this task:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.ui.Mouse;\n\nclass CustomMouseCursorExample extends Sprite {\n    private var cursor:Sprite;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        cursor = new Sprite();\n        cursor.graphics.beginFill(0x000000);\n        cursor.graphics.drawCircle(0,0,20);\n        cursor.graphics.endFill();\n        addChild(cursor);\n\n        stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE,redrawCursor);\n        Mouse.hide();\n    }\n\n    function redrawCursor(event:MouseEvent):Void\n    {\n        cursor.x = event.stageX;\n        cursor.y = event.stageY;\n    }\n}\n\n"},"touch-multitouch-and-gesture-input/":{"url":"touch-multitouch-and-gesture-input/","title":"Chapter 32: Touch, multitouch and gesture input","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 32: Touch, multitouch and gesture input \nThe touch event handling features of OpenFL include input from a single point of\ncontact or multiple points of contact on touch-enabled devices.\n In other words, OpenFL interprets the following\n\ntypes of input:\n\n**Touch**  \ninput with a single point device such as a finger, stylus, or other tool on a\ntouch-enabled device.

The TouchEvent class provides values for\nhandling touchBegin, touchMove, and touchEnd events.\nFor example, you could use touchBegin, touchMove, and touchEnd events to\ngive the user visual feedback as they touch and move a display object:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.TouchEvent;\nimport openfl.text.TextField;\nimport openfl.ui.Multitouch;\nimport openfl.ui.MultitouchInputMode;\n\nclass TouchEventPhasesExample extends Sprite {\n    private var myTextField:TextField;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        Multitouch.inputMode = MultitouchInputMode.TOUCH_POINT;\n\n        var mySprite:Sprite = new Sprite();\n        mySprite.graphics.beginFill(0x336699);\n        mySprite.graphics.drawRect(0,0,40,40);\n        addChild(mySprite);\n\n        myTextField = new TextField();\n        myTextField.width = 200;\n        myTextField.height = 20;\n        addChild(myTextField);\n\n        mySprite.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_BEGIN, onTouchBegin);\n        stage.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE, onTouchMove);\n        stage.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_END, onTouchEnd);\n    }\n\n    function onTouchBegin(event:TouchEvent):Void {\n        myTextField.text = \"touch begin\" + event.touchPointID;\n    }\n\n    function onTouchMove(event:TouchEvent):Void {\n        myTextField.text = \"touch move\" + event.touchPointID;\n    }\n\n    function onTouchEnd(event:TouchEvent):Void {\n        myTextField.text = \"touch end\" + event.touchPointID;\n    }\n}\n\nNote: The initial touch listener is attached to mySprite, but the listeners for\nmoving and ending the touch event are not. If the users's finger or pointing\ndevices moves ahead of the display object, the Stage continues to listen for the\ntouch event.\nTouch Point ID\nThe TouchEvent.touchPointID property is an essential part of writing\napplications that respond to touch input. OpenFL assigns each point of touch a\nunique touchPointID value. Whenever an application responds to the phases or\nmovement of touch input, check the touchPointID before handling the event. The\ntouch input dragging methods of the Sprite class use the touchPointID property\nas a parameter so the correct input instance is handled. The touchPointID\nproperty ensures that an event handler is responding to the correct touch point.\nOtherwise, the event handler responds to any instances of the touch event type\n(such as all touchMove events) on the device, producing unpredictable\nbehavior. The property is especially important when the user is dragging\nobjects.\nUse the touchPointID property to manage an entire touch sequence. A touch\nsequence has one touchBegin event, zero or more touchMove events, and one\ntouchEnd event that all have the same touchPointID value.\nThe following example establishes a variable touchMoveID to test for the\ncorrect touchPointID value before responding to a touch move event. Otherwise,\nother touch input triggers the event handler, too. Notice the listeners for the\nmove and end phases are on the stage, not the display object. The stage listens\nfor the move or end phases in case the user's touch moves beyond the display\nobject boundaries.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.TouchEvent;\nimport openfl.text.TextField;\nimport openfl.ui.Multitouch;\nimport openfl.ui.MultitouchInputMode;\n\nclass TouchPointIDExample extends Sprite {\n    private var mySprite:Sprite;\n    private var myTextField:TextField;\n    private var touchMoveID:Int;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        Multitouch.inputMode = MultitouchInputMode.TOUCH_POINT;\n\n        var mySprite:Sprite = new Sprite();\n        mySprite.graphics.beginFill(0x336699);\n        mySprite.graphics.drawRect(0,0,40,40);\n        addChild(mySprite);\n\n        var myTextField:TextField = new TextField();\n        myTextField.width = 200;\n        myTextField.height = 20;\n        addChild(myTextField);\n\n        touchMoveID = 0;\n\n        mySprite.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_BEGIN, onTouchBegin);\n    }\n\n    function onTouchBegin(event:TouchEvent):Void {\n        if(touchMoveID != 0) {\n            myTextField.text = \"already moving. ignoring new touch\";\n            return;\n        }\n        touchMoveID = event.touchPointID;\n\n        myTextField.text = \"touch begin\" + event.touchPointID;\n        stage.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE, onTouchMove);\n        stage.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_END, onTouchEnd);\n    }\n\n    function onTouchMove(event:TouchEvent):Void {\n        if(event.touchPointID != touchMoveID) {\n            myTextField.text = \"ignoring unrelated touch\";\n            return;\n        }\n        mySprite.x = event.stageX;\n        mySprite.y = event.stageY;\n        myTextField.text = \"touch move\" + event.touchPointID;\n    }\n\n    function onTouchEnd(event:TouchEvent):Void {\n        if(event.touchPointID != touchMoveID) {\n            myTextField.text = \"ignoring unrelated touch end\";\n            return;\n        }\n        touchMoveID = 0;\n        stage.removeEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE, onTouchMove);\n        stage.removeEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_END, onTouchEnd);\n        myTextField.text = \"touch end\" + event.touchPointID;\n    }\n}\n\n"},"touch-multitouch-and-gesture-input/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"touch-multitouch-and-gesture-input/troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting \nHardware and software support for touch input changed rapidly over time. This\nreference does not maintain a list of every device an operating system and\nsoftware combination that supports multitouch. However, it provides guidance on\nusing the discovery API to determine if your application is deployed on a device\nthat supports multitouch, and provides tips for troubleshooting your\nOpenFL code.\nOpenFL responds to touch events based on information the device,\noperating system, or containing software (such as a browser) passes to the\nruntime. This dependency on the software environment complicates documenting\nmultitouch compatibility. Some devices interpret a gesture or touch motion\ndifferently than another device. Is rotation defined by two fingers rotating at\nthe same time? Is rotation one finger drawing a circle on a screen? Depending on\nthe hardware and software environment, the rotation gesture could be either, or\nsomething entirely different. So, the device tells the operating system the user\ninput, then the operating system passes that information to the runtime. If the\nruntime is inside a browser, the browser software sometimes interprets the\ngesture or touch event and does not pass the input to the runtime. This behavior\nis similar to the behavior of keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys: you try to use a specific key\ncombination to get OpenFL to do something inside the browser and the\nbrowser keeps opening a menu instead.\nIndividual API and classes mention if they're not compatible with specific\noperating systems. You can explore individual API entries here, starting with\nthe Multitouch class:\nhttps://api.openfl.org/openfl/ui/Multitouch.html.\nHere are some common gesture and touch descriptions:\nPanMove a finger left-to-right or right-to-left. Some devices require two fingers\nto pan.\nRotateTouch two fingers down, then move them around in a circle (as if they're both\nsimultaneously tracing an imaginary circle on a surface). The pivot point is set\nat the midpoint between the two finger touch points.\nSwipeMove three fingers left-to-right or right-to-left, top-to-bottom, or\nbottom-to-top, quickly.\nZoomTouch two fingers down, then move them away from each other to zoom in and\ntoward each other to zoom out.\nPress-and-tapMove or press one finger, then tap the surface with another.\nEach device has its own documentation about the gestures the device supports and\nhow to perform each gesture on that device. In general, the user must remove all\nfingers from contact with the device between gestures, depending upon the\noperating system.\nIf you find your application is not responding to touch events or gestures, test\nthe following:\n\nDo you have event listeners for touch or gesture events attached to an\nobject class that inherits from the InteractiveObject class? Only\nInteractiveObject instances can listen for touch and gesture events\n\nStart simple and see what does work, first (the following code example is\nfrom the API entry for Multitouch.inputMode:\nMultitouch.inputMode = MultitouchInputMode.TOUCH_POINT;\n\nvar mySprite:Sprite = new Sprite();\nmySprite.graphics.beginFill(0x336699);\nmySprite.graphics.drawRect(0,0,40,40);\naddChild(mySprite);\n\nvar myTextField:TextField = new TextField();\n\nmySprite.addEventListener(TouchEvent.TOUCH_TAP, taplistener);\n\nfunction taplistener(e:TouchEvent):Void {\n    myTextField.text = \"I've been tapped\";\n    myTextField.y = 50;\n    addChild(myTextField);\n}\n\nTap the rectangle.

The methods of the\nFileReference class let your application load and save data files locally, and\ntransfer file data to and from remote servers.\nThe FileReference class offers two different approaches to loading,\ntransferring, and saving data files. Since its introduction, the FileReference\nclass has included the browse() method, the upload() method, and the\ndownload() method.\n\nUse the browse() method to let the user select a file.\nUse the upload() method to transfer the file data to a remote server.\nUse the download() method to retrieve that data from the server and save it\nin a local file.\n\nAdditionally, the FileReference class includes the load() and save()\nmethods. The load() and save() methods allow you to access and save local\nfiles directly as well. The use of those methods is similar to the\nequivalent-named methods in the URLLoader and Loader classes.\nNote: The File class,\nwhich extends the FileReference class, and the\nFileStream class\nprovide additional functions for working with files and the local file system.\nThe File and FileStream classes are only supported on native platforms and not\nin web browsers.\nFileReference class\nEach FileReference object represents a single data file on the local machine.\nThe properties of the FileReference class contain information about the file's\nsize, type, name, filename extension, creation date, and modification date.\nNote: The extension property is only supported on nativ platforms.\nYou can create an instance of the FileReference class one of two ways:\n\nUse the new operator, as shown in the following code:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\n\nclass FileReferenceConstructorExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var fileRef:FileReference = new FileReference();\n    }\n}\n\n\nCall the FileReferenceList.browse() method, which opens a dialog box and\nprompts the user to select one or more files to upload. It then creates an\narray of FileReference objects if the user successfully selects one or more\nfiles.\n\n\nOnce you have created a FileReference object, you can do the following:\n\nCall the FileReference.browse() method, which opens a dialog box and prompts\nthe user to select a single file from the local file system. This is usually\ndone before a subsequent call to the FileReference.upload() method or\nFileReference.load() method. Call the FileReference.upload() method to\nupload the file to a remote server. Call to the FileReference.load() method\nto open a local file.\n\nCall the FileReference.download() method. The download() method opens a\ndialog box to let the user select a location for saving a new file. Then it\ndownloads data from the server and stores it in the new file.\n\nCall the FileReference.load() method. This method begins loading data from a\nfile selected previously using the browse() method. The load() method\ncan't be called until the browse() operation completes (the user selects a\nfile).\n\nCall the FileReference.save() method. This method opens a dialog box and\nprompts the user to choose a single file location on the local file system. It\nthen saves data to the specified location.\n\n\nNote: You can only perform one browse(), download(), or save() action at a\ntime, because only one dialog box can be open at any point.\nThe FileReference object properties such as name, size, or\nmodificationDate are not defined until one of the following happens:\n\nThe FileReference.browse() method or FileReferenceList.browse() method has\nbeen called, and the user has selected a file using the dialog box.\n\nThe FileReference.download() method has been called, and the user has\nspecified a new file location using the dialog box.\n\n\nNote: When performing a download, only the FileReference.name property is\npopulated before the download is complete. After the file has been downloaded,\nall properties are available.\nWhile calls to the FileReference.browse(), FileReferenceList.browse(),\nFileReference.download(), FileReference.load(), or FileReference.save()\nmethods are executing, most OpenFL targets continue playback including\ndispatching events and executing code.\nFor uploading and downloading operations, OpenFL in a web browser can access\nfiles only within its own domain, including any domains allowed by Cross-origin\nresource sharing (CORS). You need to enable CORS on the server containing the\nfile if that server is not in the same domain as the OpenFL project initiating\nthe upload or download.\nSee FileReference.\nLoading data from files\nThe FileReference.load() method lets you load data from a local file into\nmemory.\nNote: Your code must first call the FileReference.browse() method to let the\nuser select a file to load. This restriction does not apply to OpenFL content on\nnative platforms.\nThe FileReference.load() method returns immediately after being called, but\nthe data being loaded isn't available immediately. The FileReference object\ndispatches events to invoke listener methods at each step of the loading\nprocess.\nThe FileReference object dispatches the following events during the loading\nprocess.\n\nopen event (Event.OPEN): Dispatched when the load operation starts.\n\nprogress event (ProgressEvent.PROGRESS): Dispatched periodically as bytes\nof data are read from the file.\n\ncomplete event (Event.COMPLETE): Dispatched when the load operation\ncompletes successfully.\n\nioError event (IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR): Dispatched if the load process\nfails because an input/output error occurs while opening or reading data from\nthe file.\n\n\nOnce the FileReference object dispatches the complete event, the loaded data can\nbe accessed as a ByteArray in the FileReference object's data property.\nThe following example shows how to prompt the user to select a file and then\nload the data from that file into memory:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.*;\nimport openfl.net.FileFilter;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\n\nclass FileReferenceExample1 extends Sprite\n{\n    private var fileRef:FileReference;\n\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        fileRef = new FileReference();\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.SELECT, onFileSelected);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.CANCEL, onCancel);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, onIOError);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR,\n                    onSecurityError);\n        var textTypeFilter:FileFilter = new FileFilter(\"Text Files (*.txt, *.rtf)\",\n                    \"*.txt;*.rtf\");\n        fileRef.browse([textTypeFilter]);\n    }\n\n    private function onFileSelected(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        fileRef.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onProgress);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onComplete);\n        fileRef.load();\n    }\n\n    private function onProgress(evt:ProgressEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"Loaded \" + evt.bytesLoaded + \" of \" + evt.bytesTotal + \" bytes.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onComplete(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"File was successfully loaded.\");\n        trace(fileRef.data);\n    }\n\n    private function onCancel(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"The browse request was canceled by the user.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onIOError(evt:IOErrorEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"There was an IO Error.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onSecurityError(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"There was a security error.\");\n    }\n}\n\nThe example code first creates the FileReference object named fileRef and then\ncalls its browse() method. The browse() method opens a dialog box that\nprompts the user to select a file. When a file is selected, the code invokes the\nonFileSelected() method. This method adds listeners for the progress and\ncomplete events and then calls the FileReference object's load() method. The\nother handler methods in the example simply output messages to report on the\nprogress of the load operation. When the loading completes, the application\ndisplays the contents of the loaded file using the trace() method.\n\nSaving data to local files\nThe FileReference.save() method lets you save data to a local file. It starts\nby opening a dialog box to let the user enter a new filename and location to\nwhich to save a file. After the user selects the filename and location, the data\nis written to the new file. When the file is saved successfully, the properties\nof the FileReference object are populated with the properties of the local file.\nNote: Your code can only call the FileReference.save() method in response to a\nuser-initiated event such as a mouse click or a keypress event. Otherwise an\nerror is thrown. This restriction does not apply to OpenFL content running on\nnative platforms.\nThe FileReference.save() method returns immediately after being called. The\nFileReference object then dispatches events to call listener methods at each\nstep of the file saving process.\nThe FileReference object dispatches the following events during the file saving\nprocess:\n\nselect event (Event.SELECT): Dispatched when the user specifies the\nlocation and file name for the new file to be saved.\n\ncancel event (Event.CANCEL): Dispatched when the user click the Cancel\nbutton in the dialog box.\n\nopen event (Event.OPEN): Dispatched when the save operation starts.\n\nprogress event (ProgressEvent.PROGRESS): Dispatched periodically as bytes\nof data are saved to the file.\n\ncomplete event (Event.COMPLETE): Dispatched when the save operation\ncompletes successfully.\n\nioError event (IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR): Dispatched if the saving process\nfails because an input/output error occurs while attempting to save data to\nthe file.\n\n\nThe type of object passed in the data parameter of the FileReference.save()\nmethod determines how the data is written to the file:\n\nIf it is a String value, then it is saved as a text file using UTF-8 encoding.\n\nIf it is a ByteArray object, then its contents are written directly to the\nfile with no conversion.\n\nIf it is some other object, then the FileReference.save() method calls the\nobject's toString() method and then saves the resulting String value to a\nUTF-8 text file. If the object's toString() method can't be called, then an\nerror is thrown.\n\n\nIf the value of the data parameter is null, then an error is thrown.\nThe following code extends the previous example for the FileReference.load()\nmethod. After reading the data from the file, this example prompts the user for\na filename and then saves the data in a new file:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.*;\nimport openfl.net.FileFilter;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\n\nclass FileReferenceExample2 extends Sprite\n{\n    private var fileRef:FileReference;\n\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        fileRef = new FileReference();\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.SELECT, onFileSelected);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.CANCEL, onCancel);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, onIOError);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR,\n                    onSecurityError);\n        var textTypeFilter:FileFilter = new FileFilter(\"Text Files (*.txt, *.rtf)\",\n                    \"*.txt;*.rtf\");\n        fileRef.browse([textTypeFilter]);\n    }\n\n    private function onFileSelected(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        fileRef.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onProgress);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onComplete);\n        fileRef.load();\n    }\n\n    private function onProgress(evt:ProgressEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"Loaded \" + evt.bytesLoaded + \" of \" + evt.bytesTotal + \" bytes.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onCancel(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"The browse request was canceled by the user.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onComplete(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"File was successfully loaded.\");\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(Event.SELECT, onFileSelected);\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onProgress);\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onComplete);\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(Event.CANCEL, onCancel);\n        saveFile();\n    }\n\n    private function saveFile():Void\n    {\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.SELECT, onSaveFileSelected);\n        fileRef.save(fileRef.data,\"NewFileName.txt\");\n    }\n\n    private function onSaveFileSelected(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        fileRef.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onSaveProgress);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onSaveComplete);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.CANCEL, onSaveCancel);\n    }\n\n    private function onSaveProgress(evt:ProgressEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"Saved \" + evt.bytesLoaded + \" of \" + evt.bytesTotal + \" bytes.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onSaveComplete(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"File saved.\");\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(Event.SELECT, onSaveFileSelected);\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onSaveProgress);\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onSaveComplete);\n        fileRef.removeEventListener(Event.CANCEL, onSaveCancel);\n    }\n\n    private function onSaveCancel(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"The save request was canceled by the user.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onIOError(evt:IOErrorEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"There was an IO Error.\");\n    }\n\n    private function onSecurityError(evt:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"There was a security error.\");\n    }\n}\n\nWhen all of the data loads from the file, the code calls the onComplete()\nmethod. The onComplete() method removes the listeners for the loading events\nand then calls the saveFile() method. The saveFile() method calls the\nFileReference.save() method. The FileReference.save() method opens a new\ndialog box to let the user enter a new filename and location to save the file.\nThe remaining event listener methods trace the progress of the file saving\nprocess until it is complete.\n\nUploading files to a server\nTo upload files to a server, first call the browse() method to allow a user to\nselect one or more files. Next, when the FileReference.upload() method is\ncalled, the selected file is transferred to the server. If the user selects\nmultiple files using the FileReferenceList.browse() method, OpenFL creates an\narray of selected files called FileReferenceList.fileList. You can then use\nthe FileReference.upload() method to upload each file individually.\nNote: Using the FileReference.browse() method allows you to upload single\nfiles only. To allow a user to upload multiple files, use the\nFileReferenceList.browse() method.\nBy default, the system file picker dialog box allows users to pick any file type\nfrom the local computer. Developers can specify one or more custom file type\nfilters by using the FileFilter class and passing an array of file filter\ninstances to the browse() method:\nvar imageTypes:FileFilter = new FileFilter(\"Images (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.png)\", \"*.jpg; *.jpeg; *.gif; *.png\");\nvar textTypes:FileFilter = new FileFilter(\"Text Files (*.txt, *.rtf)\", \"*.txt; *.rtf\");\nvar allTypes:Array = new Array(imageTypes, textTypes);\nvar fileRef:FileReference = new FileReference();\nfileRef.browse(allTypes);\n\nWhen the user has selected the files and clicked the Open button in the system\nfile picker, the Event.SELECT event is dispatched. If the\nFileReference.browse() method is used to select a file to upload, the\nfollowing code sends the file to a web server:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass FileReferenceExample3 extends Sprite {\n    private var fileRef:FileReference;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        fileRef  = new FileReference();\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.SELECT, selectHandler);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);\n        try\n        {\n            var success:Bool = fileRef.browse();\n        }\n        catch (error:Dynamic)\n        {\n            trace(\"Unable to browse for files.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private function selectHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/fileUploadScript.php\");\n        try\n        {\n            fileRef.upload(request);\n        }\n        catch (error:Dynamic)\n        {\n            trace(\"Unable to upload file.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private function completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"uploaded\");\n    }\n}\n\nTip: You can send data to the server with the FileReference.upload()\nmethod by using the URLRequest.method and URLRequest.data properties to send\nvariables using the POST or GET methods.\nWhen you attempt to upload a file using the FileReference.upload() method, the\nfollowing events are dispatched:\n\nopen event (Event.OPEN): Dispatched when the upload operation starts.\n\nprogress event (ProgressEvent.PROGRESS): Dispatched periodically as bytes\nof data from the file are uploaded.\n\ncomplete event (Event.COMPLETE): Dispatched when the upload operation\ncompletes successfully.\n\nhttpStatus event (HTTPStatusEvent.HTTP_STATUS): Dispatched when the upload\nprocess fails because of an HTTP error.\n\nhttpResponseStatus event (HTTPStatusEvent.HTTP_RESPONSE_STATUS):\nDispatched if a call to the upload() or uploadUnencoded() method attempts\nto access data over HTTP and OpenFL is able to detect and return the status\ncode for the request.\n\nsecurityError event (SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR): Dispatched when\nan upload operation fails because of a security violation.\n\nuploadCompleteData event (DataEvent.UPLOAD_COMPLETE_DATA): Dispatched\nafter data is received from the server after a successful upload.\n\nioError event (IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR): Dispatched if the upload process\nfails for any of the following reasons:\n\nAn input/output error occurred while OpenFL is reading, writing, or\ntransmitting the file.\n\nOpenFL tried to upload a file to a server that requires authentication (such\nas a user name and password). During upload, OpenFL does not provide a means\nfor users to enter passwords.\n\nThe url parameter contains an invalid protocol. The\nFileReference.upload() method must use either HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code demonstrates file uploads using PHP, and it includes data\nvalidation. The script limits the number of uploaded files in the upload\ndirectory to 10, ensures that the file is less than 200 KB, and permits only\nJPEG, GIF, or PNG files to be uploaded and saved to the file system.\n $MAXIMUM_FILE_COUNT)\n    {\n        $files_to_delete = array_splice($files, 0, count($files) - $MAXIMUM_FILE_COUNT);\n        for ($i = 0; $i \n\nYou can pass additional variables to the upload script using either the POST\nor GET request method. To send additional POST variables to your upload\nscript, you can use the following code:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequestMethod;\nimport openfl.net.URLVariables;\n\nclass FileReferenceExample4 extends Sprite\n{\n    private var fileRef:FileReference = new FileReference();\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        fileRef = new FileReference();\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.SELECT, selectHandler);\n        fileRef.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);\n        fileRef.browse();\n    }\n\n    private function selectHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var params:URLVariables = new URLVariables();\n        params.date = Date.now();\n        params.ssid = \"94103-1394-2345\";\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/ssidfileupload.php\");\n        request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\n        request.data = params;\n        fileRef.upload(request, \"Custom1\");\n    }\n\n    private function completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"uploaded\");\n    }\n}\n\nThe previous example creates a URLVariables object that you pass to the remote\nserver- side script. In older versions of Adobe Flash, you could pass variables\nto the server upload script by passing values in the query string. OpenFL allows\nyou to pass variables to the remote script using a URLRequest object, which\nallows you to pass data using either the POST or GET method; this, in turn,\nmakes passing larger sets of data easier and cleaner. In order to specify\nwhether the variables are passed using the GET or POST request method, you\ncan set the URLRequest.method property to either URLRequestMethod.GET or\nURLRequestMethod.POST, respectively.\nOpenFL also lets you override the default Filedata upload file field name by\nproviding a second parameter to the upload() method, as demonstrated in the\nprevious example (which replaced the default value Filedata with Custom1).\n\nThe server script that handles the file upload should expect an HTTP POST\nrequest with the following elements:\n\nContent-Type with a value of multipart/form-data.\n\nContent-Disposition with a name attribute set to \"Filedata\" and a\nfilename attribute set to the name of the original file. You can specify a\ncustom name attribute by passing a value for the uploadDataFieldName\nparameter in the FileReference.upload() method.\n\nThe binary contents of the file.\n\n\nHere is a sample HTTP POST request:\nPOST /handler.php HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/*\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data;\nboundary=----------Ij5ae0ae0KM7GI3KM7ei4cH2ei4gL6\nUser-Agent: curl/7.83.1\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: 421\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n------------Ij5ae0ae0KM7GI3KM7ei4cH2ei4gL6\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Filename\"\n\nsushi.jpg\n------------Ij5ae0ae0KM7GI3KM7ei4cH2ei4gL6\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Filedata\"; filename=\"sushi.jpg\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\nTest File\n------------Ij5ae0ae0KM7GI3KM7ei4cH2ei4gL6\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Upload\"\n\nSubmit Query\n------------Ij5ae0ae0KM7GI3KM7ei4cH2ei4gL6\n(actual file data,,,)\nThe following sample HTTP POST request sends three POST variables:\napi_sig, api_key, and auth_token, and uses a custom upload data field name\nvalue of \"photo\":\nPOST /handler.php HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/*\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data;\nboundary=----------Ij5ae0ae0KM7GI3KM7ei4cH2ei4gL6\nUser-Agent: curl/7.83.1\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: 421\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Filename\"\n\nsushi.jpg\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"api_sig\"\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"api_key\"\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"auth_token\"\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"photo\"; filename=\"sushi.jpg\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n(actual file data,,,)\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"Upload\"\n\nSubmit Query\n------------Ij5GI3GI3ei4GI3ei4KM7GI3KM7KM7--\nDownloading files from a server\nYou can let users download files from a server using the\nFileReference.download() method, which takes two parameters: request and\ndefaultFileName. The first parameter is the URLRequest object that contains\nthe URL of the file to download. The second parameter is optional—it lets you\nspecify a default filename that appears in the download file dialog box. If you\nomit the second parameter, defaultFileName, the filename from the specified\nURL is used.\nThe following code downloads a file named index.xml from the same directory as\nthe OpenFL content:\nvar request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"index.xml\");\nvar fileRef:FileReference = new FileReference();\nfileRef.download(request);\n\nTo set the default name to currentnews.xml instead of index.xml, specify the\ndefaultFileName parameter, as the following snippet shows:\nvar request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"index.xml\");\nvar fileToDownload:FileReference = new FileReference();\nfileToDownload.download(request, \"currentnews.xml\");\n\nRenaming a file can be useful if the server filename was not intuitive or was\nserver-generated. It's also good to explicitly specify the defaultFileName\nparameter when you download a file using a server-side script, instead of\ndownloading the file directly. For example, you need to specify the\ndefaultFileName parameter if you have a server-side script that downloads\nspecific files based on URL variables passed to it. Otherwise, the default name\nof the downloaded file is the name of your server-side script.\nData can be sent to the server using the download() method by appending\nparameters to the URL for the server script to parse. The following Haxe code\nsnippet downloads a document based on which parameters are passed to a\nserver-side script:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequestMethod;\nimport openfl.net.URLVariables;\n\nclass DownloadFileExample extends Sprite\n{\n    private var fileToDownload:FileReference;\n\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest();\n        request.url = \"http://www.example.com/downloadfile.php\";\n        request.method = URLRequestMethod.GET;\n        request.data = new URLVariables(\"id=2\");\n        fileToDownload = new FileReference();\n        try\n        {\n            fileToDownload.download(request, \"file2.txt\");\n        }\n        catch (error:Dynamic)\n        {\n            trace(\"Unable to download file.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe following code demonstrates the PHP script, downloadfile.php, that downloads\none of two files from the server, depending on the value of a URL variable:\n\n\nFileReferenceList class\nThe FileReferenceList class lets the user select one or more files to upload to\na server-side script. The file upload is handled by the FileReference.upload()\nmethod, which must be called on each file that the user selects.\nThe following code creates two FileFilter objects (imageFilter and\ntextFilter) and passes them in an array to the FileReferenceList.browse()\nmethod. This causes the operating system file dialog box to display two possible\nfilters for file types.\nvar imageFilter:FileFilter = new FileFilter(\"Image Files (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.png)\", \"*.jpg; *.jpeg; *.gif; *.png\");\nvar textFilter:FileFilter = new FileFilter(\"Text Files (*.txt, *.rtf)\", \"*.txt; *.rtf\");\nvar fileRefList:FileReferenceList = new FileReferenceList();\ntry\n{\n    var success:Bool = fileRefList.browse(new Array(imageFilter, textFilter));\n}\ncatch (error:Error)\n{\n    trace(\"Unable to browse for files.\");\n}\n\nAllowing the user to select and upload one or more files by using the\nFileReferenceList class is the same as using FileReference.browse() to select\nfiles, although the FileReferenceList allows you to select more than one file.\nUploading multiple files requires you to upload each of the selected files by\nusing FileReference.upload(), as the following code shows:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.net.FileReference;\nimport openfl.net.FileReferenceList;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass FileReferenceListExample extends Sprite\n{\n    private var fileRefList:FileReferenceList;\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        var fileRefList:FileReferenceList = new FileReferenceList();\n        fileRefList.addEventListener(Event.SELECT, selectHandler);\n        fileRefList.browse();\n    }\n\n    private function selectHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/fileUploadScript.php\");\n        var file:FileReference;\n        var files:FileReferenceList = cast(event.target, FileReferenceList);\n        var selectedFileArray:Array = files.fileList;\n        for (i in 0...selectedFileArray.length)\n        {\n            file = selectedFileArray[i];\n            file.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);\n            try\n            {\n                file.upload(request);\n            }\n            catch (error:Dynamic)\n            {\n                trace(\"Unable to upload files.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private function completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"uploaded\");\n    }\n}\n\nBecause the Event.COMPLETE event is added to each individual FileReference\nobject in the array, OpenFL calls the completeHandler() method when each\nindividual file finishes uploading.\n"},"working-with-byte-arrays/":{"url":"working-with-byte-arrays/","title":"Chapter 41: Working with byte arrays","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 41: Working with byte arrays \nThe ByteArray class allows\nyou to read from and write to a binary stream of data, which is essentially an\narray of bytes. This class provides a way to access data at the most elemental\nlevel. Because computer data consists of bytes, or groups of 8 bits, the ability\nto read data in bytes means that you can access data for which classes and\naccess methods do not exist. The ByteArray class allows you to parse any stream\nof data, from a bitmap to a stream of data traveling over the network, at the\nbyte level.\nThe writeObject() method allows you to write an object in serialized format to\na ByteArray, while the readObject() method allows you to read a serialized\nobject from a ByteArray to a variable of the original data type. You can\nserialize any object except for display objects, which are those objects that\ncan be placed on the display list. You can also assign serialized objects back\nto custom class instances if the custom class is available to the runtime. After\nserializing an object to bytes, you can efficiently transfer it over a network\nconnection or save it to a file.\n\nObjects in Adobe Flash were always serialized using Action Message Format\n(abbreviated as AMF).

To\ncreate a ByteArray object in Haxe, import the ByteArray class and invoke the\nconstructor, as shown in the following example:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.utils.ByteArray;\n\nclass CreateByteArrayExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var stream:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\n    }\n}\n\nByteArray methods\nAny meaningful data stream is organized into a format that you can analyze to\nfind the information that you want. A record in a simple employee file, for\nexample, would probably include an ID number, a name, an address, a phone\nnumber, and so on. An MP3 audio file contains an ID3 tag that identifies the\ntitle, author, album, publishing date, and genre of the file that's being\ndownloaded. The format allows you to know the order in which to expect the data\non the data stream. It allows you to read the byte stream intelligently.\nThe ByteArray class includes several methods that make it easier to read from\nand write to a data stream. Some of these methods include readBytes() and\nwriteBytes(), readInt() and writeInt(), readFloat() and writeFloat(),\nreadObject() and writeObject(), and readUTFBytes() and writeUTFBytes().\nThese methods enable you to read data from the data stream into variables of\nspecific data types and write from specific data types directly to the binary\ndata stream.\nFor example, the following code reads a simple array of strings and\nfloating-point numbers and writes each element to a ByteArray. The organization\nof the array allows the code to call the appropriate ByteArray methods\n(writeUTFBytes() and writeFloat()) to write the data. The repeating data\npattern makes it possible to read the array with a loop.\n// The following example reads a simple Array (groceries), made up of strings\n// and floating-point numbers, and writes it to a ByteArray.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.utils.ByteArray;\n\nclass WriteByteArrayExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        // define the grocery list Array\n        var groceries:Array = [\"milk\", 4.50, \"soup\", 1.79, \"eggs\", 3.19, \"bread\", 2.35];\n        // define the ByteArray\n        var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\n        // for each item in the array\n        var i = 0;\n        while (i \nThe position property\nThe position property stores the current position of the pointer that indexes\nthe ByteArray during reading or writing. The initial value of the position\nproperty is 0 (zero) as shown in the following code:\nvar bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\ntrace(\"bytes.position is initially: \" + bytes.position);     // 0\n\nWhen you read from or write to a ByteArray, the method that you use updates the\nposition property to point to the location immediately following the last byte\nthat was read or written. For example, the following code writes a string to a\nByteArray and afterward the position property points to the byte immediately\nfollowing the string in the ByteArray:\nvar bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\ntrace(\"bytes.position is initially: \" + bytes.position);     // 0\nbytes.writeUTFBytes(\"Hello World!\");\ntrace(\"bytes.position is now: \" + bytes.position);    // 12\n\nLikewise, a read operation increments the position property by the number of\nbytes read.\nvar bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\n\ntrace(\"bytes.position is initially: \" + bytes.position);     // 0\nbytes.writeUTFBytes(\"Hello World!\");\ntrace(\"bytes.position is now: \" + bytes.position);    // 12\nbytes.position = 0;\ntrace(\"The first 6 bytes are: \" + (bytes.readUTFBytes(6)));    //Hello\ntrace(\"And the next 6 bytes are: \" + (bytes.readUTFBytes(6)));    // World!\n\nNotice that you can set the position property to a specific location in the\nByteArray to read or write at that offset.\nThe bytesAvailable and length properties\nThe length and bytesAvailable properties tell you how long a ByteArray is\nand how many bytes remain in it from the current position to the end. The\nfollowing example illustrates how you can use these properties. The example\nwrites a String of text to the ByteArray and then reads the ByteArray one byte\nat a time until it encounters either the character \"a\" or the end\n(bytesAvailable ).\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.utils.ByteArray;\n\nclass BytesAvailableAndLengthExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\n        var text:String = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

An integer, for example, can\ntake 4 bytes, or 32 bits, of memory. Some computers store the most significant\nbyte of the number first, in the lowest memory address, and others store the\nleast significant byte first. This attribute of a computer, or of byte ordering,\nis referred to as being either big endian (most significant byte first) or\nlittle endian (least significant byte first). For example, the number\n0x31323334 would be stored as follows for big endian and little endian byte\nordering, where a0 represents the lowest memory address of the 4 bytes and a3\nrepresents the highest:\n\n\n\nBig Endian\nBig Endian\nBig Endian\nBig Endian\n\n\n\n\na0\na1\na2\na3\n\n\n31\n32\n33\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Endian\nLittle Endian\nLittle Endian\nLittle Endian\n\n\n\n\na0\na1\na2\na3\n\n\n34\n33\n32\n31\n\n\n\nThe endian property of the ByteArray class allows you to denote this byte\norder for multibyte numbers that you are processing. The acceptable values for\nthis property are either \"bigEndian\" or \"littleEndian\" and the Endian class\ndefines the constants BIG_ENDIAN and LITTLE_ENDIAN for setting the endian\nproperty with these strings.\nThe compress() and uncompress() methods\nThe compress() method allows you to compress a ByteArray in accordance with a\ncompression algorithm that you specify as a parameter. The uncompress() method\nallows you to uncompress a compressed ByteArray in accordance with a compression\nalgorithm. After calling compress() and uncompress(), the length of the byte\narray is set to the new length and the position property is set to the end.\nThe CompressionAlgorithm class defines constants that you can use to specify the\ncompression algorithm. The ByteArray class supports the deflate (AIR-only),\nzlib, and lzma algorithms. The zlib compressed data format is described at\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt. The lzma algorithm is described at\nhttp://www.7-zip.org/7z.html.\nThe deflate compression algorithm is used in several compression formats, such\nas zlib, gzip, and some zip implementations. The deflate compression algorithm\nis described at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt.\nThe following example compresses a ByteArray called bytes using the lzma\nalgorithm:\nbytes.compress(CompressionAlgorithm.LZMA);\n\nThe following example uncompresses a compressed ByteArray using the deflate\nalgorithm:\nbytes.uncompress(CompressionAlgorithm.LZMA);\n\nReading and writing objects\nThe readObject() and writeObject() methods read an object from and write an\nobject to a ByteArray, encoded in a serialized format, such as\nHaxe Serialization Format,\nJSON, or Action Message Format (AMF). These object serialization formats are\nused by various OpenFL classes, including NetConnection, NetStream,\nLocalConnection, and Shared Objects.\nThe ByteArray.objectEncoding property specifies the serialization format that\nis used to encode the object data. The openfl.net.ObjectEncoding class defines\nconstants for specifying the serialization format:\n\nObjectEncoding.HXSF\nObjectEncoding.JSON\nObjectEncoding.AMF0\nObjectEncoding.AMF3\n\nThe following example calls writeObject() to write an XML object to a\nByteArray, which it then compresses using the Deflate algorithm and writes to\nthe order file on the desktop. The example uses a label to display the message\n\"Wrote order file to desktop!\" in the OpenFL window when it is finished.\nimport openfl.filesystem.*;\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.text.TextField;\nimport openfl.utils.ByteArray;\nimport openfl.utils.CompressionAlgorithm;\n\nclass WriteObjectExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray();\n        var myLabel:TextField = new TextField();\n        myLabel.x = 150;\n        myLabel.y = 150;\n        myLabel.width = 200;\n        addChild(myLabel);\n\n        var order:Dynamic = {\n            items: [\n                {id: '1', menuName: 'burger', price: 3.95},\n                {id: '2', menuName: 'fries', price: 1.45},\n            ]\n        };\n\n        // Write order object to ByteArray\n        bytes.writeObject(order);\n        bytes.position = 0; // reset position to beginning\n        bytes.compress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE); // compress ByteArray\n        writeBytesToFile(\"order.dat\", bytes);\n        myLabel.text = \"Wrote order file to desktop!\";\n    }\n\n    function writeBytesToFile(fileName:String, data:ByteArray):Void {\n        var outFile:File = File.desktopDirectory; // dest folder is desktop\n        outFile = outFile.resolvePath(fileName); // name of file to write\n        var outStream:FileStream = new FileStream();\n        // open output file stream in WRITE mode\n        outStream.open(outFile, FileMode.WRITE);\n        // write out the file\n        outStream.writeBytes(data, 0, data.length);\n        // close it\n        outStream.close();\n    }\n}\n\nThe readObject() method reads an object in serialized format from a ByteArray\nand stores it in an object of the specified type.

Those sources\ncan provide static content such as text files, or dynamic content generated by a\nweb server backend script. The data can be formatted in various ways, and OpenFL\nprovides functionality for decoding and accessing the data. You can also send\ndata to the external server as part of the process of retrieving data.\nUsing the URLRequest class\nMany APIs that load external data use the URLRequest class to define the\nproperties of necessary network request.\nURLRequest properties\nYou can set the following properties of a URLRequest object in any security\nsandbox:\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncontentType\nThe MIME content type of any data sent with the URL request. If no contentType is set, values are sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n\n\ndata\nAn object containing data to be transmitted with the URL request.\n\n\nmethod\nThe HTTP request method, such as a GET or POST.\n\n\nrequestHeaders\nThe array of HTTP request headers to be appended to the HTTP request. Note that permission to set some headers is restricted on some targets.\n\n\nurl\nSpecifies the URL to be requested.\n\n\n\nOn OpenFL native targets, you can set additional properties of the URLRequest\nclass.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfollowRedirects\nSpecifies whether redirects are to be followed (true, the default value) or not (false).\n\n\nmanageCookies\nSpecifies whether the HTTP protocol stack should manage cookies (true, the default value) or not (false) for this request.\n\n\nauthenticate\nSpecifies whether authentication requests should be handled (true) for this request. The default is to authenticate requests—which may cause an authentication dialog box to be displayed if the server requires credentials. You can also set the user name and password using the URLRequestDefaults class—see Setting URLRequest defaults.\n\n\ncacheResponse\nSpecifies whether response data should be cached for this request. The default is to cache the response (true).\n\n\nuseCache\nSpecifies whether the local cache should be consulted before this URLRequest fetches data. The default (true) is to use the local cached version, if available.\n\n\nuserAgent\nSpecifies the user-agent string to be used in the HTTP request.\n\n\n\nSetting URLRequest defaults\nThe URLRequestDefaults class lets you define application-specific default\nsettings for URLRequest objects. For example, the following code sets the\ndefault values for the manageCookies and useCache properties. All new\nURLRequest objects will use the specified values for these properties instead of\nthe normal defaults:\nURLRequestDefaults.manageCookies = false;\nURLRequestDefaults.useCache = false;\n\n\nFor more information, see the\nURLRequestDefaults\nclass listing in the OpenFL API Reference.\nURI schemes\nThe standard URI schemes, such as the following, can be used in requests made\nfrom any security sandbox:\nhttp: and https:\nUse these for standard Internet URLs (in the same way that they are used in a\nweb browser).\nfile:\nUse file: to specify the URL of a file located on the local file system. For\nexample:\nfile:///c:/AIR Test/test.txt\nIn AIR, you can also use the following schemes when defining a URL for content\nrunning in the application security sandbox:\napp:\nUse app: to specify a path relative to the root directory of the installed\napplication. For example, the following path points to a resources subdirectory\nof the directory of the installed application:\napp:/resources\nThe URL (and url property) for a File object created with\nFile.applicationDirectory may use the app URI scheme, as in the following:\nvar dir:File = File.applicationDirectory;\ndir = dir.resolvePath(\"assets\");\ntrace(dir.url); // app:/assets\n\napp-storage:\nUse app-storage: to specify a path relative to the data storage directory of\nthe application. For each installed application (and user), AIR creates a unique\napplication storage directory, which is a useful place to store data specific to\nthat application. For example, the following path points to a prefs.xml file in\na settings subdirectory of the application store directory:\napp-storage:/settings/prefs.xml\nThe URL (and url property) for a File object created with\nFile.applicationStorageDirectory may use the app-storage URI scheme, as in\nthe following:\nvar prefsFile:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory;\nprefsFile = prefsFile.resolvePath(\"prefs.xml\");\ntrace(dir.prefsFile); // app-storage:/prefs.xml\n\n\nYou can use a URLRequest object that uses any of these URI schemes to define the\nURL request for a number of different objects, such as a FileStream or a Sound\nobject.\nSetting URL variables\nWhile you can add variables to the URL string directly, it can be easier to use\nthe URLVariables class to define any variables needed for a request.\nThere are three ways in which you can add parameters to a URLVariables object:\n\nWithin the URLVariables constructor\n\nWith the URLVariables.decode() method\n\nAs dynamic properties of the URLVariables object itself\n\n\nThe following example illustrates all three methods and also how to assign the\nvariables to a URLRequest object:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\nimport openfl.net.URLVariables;\nimport openfl.Lib;\n\nclass URLVariablesExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var urlVar:URLVariables = new URLVariables(\"one=1&two=2\");\n        urlVar.decode(\"amp=\" + Lib.encodeURIComponent(\"&\") );\n        urlVar.three = 3;\n        urlVar.amp2 = \"&&\";\n        trace(Std.string(urlVar)); //amp=%26&amp2=%26%26&one=1&two=2&three=3\n\n        var urlRequest:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/test/\");\n        urlRequest.data = urlVar;\n    }\n}\n\nWhen you define variables within the URLVariables constructor or within the\nURLVariables.decode() method, make sure that you URL-encode the characters\nthat have a special meaning in a URI string. For example, when you use an\nampersand in a parameter name or value, you must encode the ampersand by\nchanging it from & to %26 because the ampersand acts as a delimiter for\nparameters. The top-level encodeURIComponent() function can be used for this\npurpose.\nUsing the URLLoader class\nThe URLLoader class let you send a request to a server and access the\ninformation returned. You can also use the URLLoader class to access files on\nthe local file system in contexts where local file access is permitted. The\nURLLoader class downloads data from a URL as text, binary data, or URL-encoded\nvariables. The URLLoader class dispatches events such as complete,\nhttpStatus, ioError, open, progress, and securityError.\nFor more information on handling events in OpenFL, see\nHandling events\nDownloaded data is not available until the download has completed. You can\nmonitor the progress of the download (bytes loaded and bytes total) by listening\nfor the progress event to be dispatched. However, if a file loads quickly\nenough a progress event might not be dispatched. When a file has successfully\ndownloaded, the complete event is dispatched. By setting the URLLoader\ndataFormat property, you can receive the data as text, raw binary data, or as\na URLVariables object.\nThe URLLoader.load() method (and optionally the URLLoader class's constructor)\ntakes a single parameter, request, which is a URLRequest object. A URLRequest\nobject contains all of the information for a single HTTP request, such as the\ntarget URL, request method (GET or POST), additional header information, and\nthe MIME type.\nFor example, to upload an XML packet to a server-side script, you could use the\nfollowing code:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoader;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequestMethod;\n\nclass URLLoaderPostExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var secondsUTC:Float = Date.now().getTime();\n        var dataXML:Xml = Xml.parse('\n                $secondsUTC\n            ');\n\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/time/\");\n        request.contentType = \"text/xml\";\n        request.data = Std.string(dataXML);\n        request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\n\n        var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n        loader.load(request);\n    }\n}\n\nThe previous snippet creates an XML document named dataXML that contains the\nXML packet to be sent to the server. The example sets the URLRequest\ncontentType property to \"text/xml\" and assigns the XML document to the\nURLRequest data property. Finally, the example creates a URLLoader object and\nsends the request to the remote script by using the load() method.\nUsing the URLStream class\nThe URLStream class provides access to the downloading data as the data arrives.\nThe URLStream class also lets you close a stream before it finishes downloading.\nThe downloaded data is available as raw binary data.\nWhen reading data from a URLStream object, use the bytesAvailable property to\ndetermine whether sufficient data is available before reading it. An EOFError\nexception is thrown if you attempt to read more data than is available.\nThe httpResponseStatus event\nOn some targets, the URLStream class dispatches an httpResponseStatus event in\naddition to the httpStatus event. The httpResponseStatus event is delivered\nbefore any response data. The httpResponseStatus event (represented by the\nHTTPStatusEvent class) includes a responseURL property, which is the URL that\nthe response was returned from, and a responseHeaders property, which is an\narray of URLRequestHeader objects representing the response headers that the\nresponse returned.\nLoading data from external documents\nWhen you build dynamic applications, it can be useful to load data from external\nfiles or from server-side scripts. This lets you build dynamic applications\nwithout having to edit or recompile your application. For example, if you build\na \"tip of the day\" application, you can write a server-side script that\nretrieves a random tip from a database and saves it to a text file once a day.\nThen your application can load the contents of a static text file instead of\nquerying the database each time.\nThe following snippet creates a URLRequest and URLLoader object, which loads the\ncontents of an external text file, params.txt:\nvar request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"params.txt\");\nvar loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\nloader.load(request);\n\nBy default, if you do not define a request method, OpenFL loads the content\nusing the HTTP GET method. To send the request using the POST method, set\nthe request.method property to POST using the static constant\nURLRequestMethod.POST, as the following code shows:\nvar request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"https://www.example.com/sendfeedback/\");\nrequest.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\n\nThe external document, params.txt, that is loaded at run time contains the\nfollowing data:\nmonthNames=January,February,March,April,May,June,July,August,September,October,November,December&dayNames=Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday\nThe file contains two parameters, monthNames and dayNames. Each parameter\ncontains a comma-separated list that is parsed as strings. You can split this\nlist into an array using the String.split() method.\n\nAvoid using reserved words or language constructs as variable names in\nexternal data files, because doing so makes reading and debugging your code\nmore difficult.\n\nOnce the data has loaded, the complete event is dispatched, and the contents\nof the external document are available to use in the URLLoader's data\nproperty, as the following code shows:\nfunction completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n{\n    var loader2:URLLoader = cast(event.target, URLLoader);\n    trace(loader2.data);\n}\n\nIf the remote document contains name-value pairs, you can parse the data using\nthe URLVariables class by passing in the contents of the loaded file, as\nfollows:\nprivate function completeHandler(event:Event):void\n{\n    var loader2:URLLoader = cast(event.target, URLLoader);\n    var variables:URLVariables = new URLVariables(loader2.data);\n    trace(variables.dayNames);\n}\n\nEach name-value pair from the external file is created as a property in the\nURLVariables object. Each property within the variables object in the previous\ncode sample is treated as a string. If the value of the name-value pair is a\nlist of items, you can convert the string into an array by calling the\nString.split() method, as follows:\nvar dayNameArray:Array = variables.dayNames.split(\",\");\n\nIf you are loading numeric data from external text files, convert the values\ninto numeric values by using a top-level function, such as Std.parseInt() or\nStd.parseFloat().\n\nInstead of loading the contents of the remote file as a string and creating a\nnew URLVariables object, you could instead set the URLLoader.dataFormat\nproperty to one of the static properties found in the URLLoaderDataFormat class.\nThe three possible values for the URLLoader.dataFormat property are as\nfollows:\n\nURLLoaderDataFormat.BINARY — The URLLoader.data property will contain\nbinary data stored in a ByteArray object.\n\nURLLoaderDataFormat.TEXT — The URLLoader.data property will contain text\nin a String object.\n\nURLLoaderDataFormat.VARIABLES — The URLLoader.data property will contain\nURL-encoded variables stored in a URLVariables object.\n\n\nThe following code demonstrates how setting the URLLoader.dataFormat property\nto URLLoaderDataFormat.VARIABLES allows you to automatically parse loaded data\ninto a URLVariables object:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.*;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoader;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoaderDataFormat;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass URLLoaderDataFormatExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/params.txt\");\n        var variables:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n        variables.dataFormat = URLLoaderDataFormat.VARIABLES;\n        variables.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);\n        try\n        {\n            variables.load(request);\n        }\n        catch (error:Error)\n        {\n            trace(\"Unable to load URL: \" + error);\n        }\n    }\n    private function completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var loader:URLLoader = URLLoader(event.target);\n        trace(loader.data.dayNames);\n    }\n}\n\nNote: The default value for URLLoader.dataFormat is\nURLLoaderDataFormat.TEXT.\nAs the following example shows, loading XML from an external file is the same as\nloading URLVariables. You can create a URLRequest instance and a URLLoader\ninstance and use them to download a remote XML document. When the file has\ncompletely downloaded, the Event.COMPLETE event is dispatched and the contents\nof the external file are converted to an XML instance, which you can parse using\nXML methods and properties.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.errors.*;\nimport openfl.events.*;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoader;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass ExternalDocs extends Sprite\n{\n    public function new()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"http://www.example.com/data.xml\");\n        var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n        loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);\n        try\n        {\n            loader.load(request);\n        }\n        catch (error:ArgumentError)\n        {\n            trace(\"An ArgumentError has occurred.\");\n        }\n        catch (error:SecurityError)\n        {\n            trace(\"A SecurityError has occurred.\");\n        }\n        catch (error:Dynamic)\n        {\n            trace(\"An unknown has occurred.\");\n        }\n    }\n    private function completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var dataXML:Xml = Xml.parse(event.target.data);\n        trace(Std.string(dataXML));\n    }\n}\n\nCommunicating with external scripts\nIn addition to loading external data files, you can also use the URLVariables\nclass to send variables to a server-side script and process the server's\nresponse. This is useful, for example, if you are programming a game and want to\nsend the user's score to a server to calculate whether it should be added to the\nhigh scores list, or even send a user's login information to a server for\nvalidation. A server-side script can process the user name and password,\nvalidate it against a database, and return confirmation of whether the\nuser-supplied credentials are valid.\nThe following snippet creates a URLVariables object named variables, which\ncreates a new variable called name. Next, a URLRequest object is created that\nspecifies the URL of the server-side script to send the variables to. Then you\nset the method property of the URLRequest object to send the variables as an\nHTTP POST request. To add the URLVariables object to the URL request, you set\nthe data property of the URLRequest object to the URLVariables object created\nearlier. Finally, the URLLoader instance is created and the URLLoader.load()\nmethod is invoked, which initiates the request.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoader;\nimport openfl.net.URLLoaderDataFormat;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequestMethod;\nimport openfl.net.URLVariables;\n\nclass GreetingExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var variables:URLVariables = new URLVariables(\"name=Franklin\");\n        var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest();\n        request.url = \"http://www.example.com/greeting.php\";\n        request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST;\n        request.data = variables;\n        var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();\n        loader.dataFormat = URLLoaderDataFormat.VARIABLES;\n        loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, completeHandler);\n        try\n        {\n            loader.load(request);\n        }\n        catch (error:Dynamic)\n        {\n            trace(\"Unable to load URL\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    function completeHandler(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        trace(event.target.data.welcomeMessage);\n    }\n}\n\nThe following code contains the contents of the PHP greeting.php document used\nin the previous example:\n\nwelcomeMessage=\n\n"}}}
