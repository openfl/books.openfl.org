events","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Handling events \nAn event-handling system allows programmers to respond to user input and system events in a convenient way. The OpenFL event model is not only convenient, but also standards-compliant, and well integrated with the display list. Based on the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification, an industry-standard event- handling architecture, the new event model provides a powerful yet intuitive event-handling tool for Haxe programmers.\nThe OpenFL event-handling system interacts closely with the display list. To gain a basic understanding of the display list, read Display programming.\nMore Help topics\n\nopenfl.events package\nDocument Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification\n\n"},"handling-events/basics-of-handling-events.html":{"url":"handling-events/basics-of-handling-events.html","title":"Basics of handling events","keywords":"","body":"Basics of handling events \nYou can think of events as occurrences of any kind in your project that are of interest to you as a programmer. For example, most projects support user interaction of some sort—whether it’s something as simple as responding to a mouse click or something more complex, such as accepting and processing data entered into a form. Any such user interaction with your project is considered an event. Events can also occur without any direct user interaction, such as when data has finished loading from a server or when an attached camera has become active.\nIn OpenFL, each event is represented by an event object, which is an instance of the Event class or one of its subclasses. An event object not only stores information about a specific event, but also contains methods that facilitate manipulation of the event object. For example, when OpenFL detects a mouse click, it creates an event object (an instance of the MouseEvent class) to represent that particular mouse click event.\nAfter creating an event object, OpenFL dispatches it, which means that the event object is passed to the object that is the target of the event. An object that serves as the destination for a dispatched event object is called an event target. For example, when an attached camera becomes active, OpenFL dispatches an event object directly to the event target, which in this case is the object that represents the camera. If the event target is on the display list, however, the event object is passed down through the display list hierarchy until it reaches the event target. In some cases, the event object then \"bubbles\" back up the display list hierarchy along the same route. This traversal of the display list hierarchy is called the event flow.\nYou can \"listen\" for event objects in your code using event listeners. Event listeners are the functions or methods that you write to respond to specific events. To ensure that your program responds to events, you must add event listeners either to the event target or to any display list object that is part of an event object’s event flow.\nAny time you write event listener code, it follows this basic structure (elements in bold are placeholders you’d fill in for your specific case):\nprivate function eventResponse (eventObject:EventType):Void {\n\n    // Actions performed in response to the event go here.\n\n}\n\neventTarget.addEventListener (EventType.EVENT_NAME, eventResponse);\n\nThis code does two things. First, it defines a function, which is the way to specify the actions that will be performed in response to the event. Next, it calls the addEventListener() method of the source object, in essence \"subscribing\" the function to the specified event so that when the event happens, the function’s actions are carried out. When the event actually happens, the event target checks its list of all the functions and methods that are registered as event listeners. It then calls each one in turn, passing the event object as a parameter.\nYou need to alter four things in this code to create your own event listener. First, you must change the name of the function to the name you want to use (this must be changed in two places, where the code says eventResponse). Second, you must specify the appropriate class name of the event object that is dispatched by the event you want to listen for (EventType in the code), and you must specify the appropriate constant for the specific event (EVENT_NAME in the listing). Third, you must call the addEventListener() method on the object that will dispatch the event (eventTarget in this code). Optionally, you can change the name of the variable used as the function’s parameter (eventObject in this code).\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter when writing event-handling routines:\nBubbling Bubbling occurs for some events so that a parent display object can respond to events dispatched by its children.\nBubbling phase The part of the event flow in which an event propagates up to parent display objects. The bubbling phase occurs after the capture and target phases.\nCapture phase The part of the event flow in which an event propagates down from the most general target to the most specific target object. The capture phase occurs before the target and bubbling phases.\nDefault behavior Some events include a behavior that normally happens along with the event, known as the default behavior. For example, when a user types text in a text field, a text input event is raised. The default behavior for that event is to actually display the character that was typed into the text field—but you can override that default behavior (if for some reason you don’t want the typed character to be displayed).\nDispatch To notify event listeners that an event has occurred.\nEvent Something that happens to an object that the object can tell other objects about.\nEvent flow When events happen to an object on the display list (an object displayed on the screen), all the objects that contain the object are notified of the event and notify their event listeners in turn. This process starts with the Stage and proceeds through the display list to the actual object where the event occurred, and then proceeds back to the Stage again. This process is known as the event flow.\nEvent object An object that contains information about a particular event’s occurrence, which is sent to all listeners when an event is dispatched.\nEvent target The object that actually dispatches an event. For example, if the user clicks a button that is inside a Sprite that is in turn inside the Stage, all those objects dispatch events, but the event target is the one where the event actually happened—in this case, the clicked button.\nListener An object or function that has registered itself with an object, to indicate that it should be notified when a specific event takes place.\nTarget phase The point of the event flow at which an event has reached the most specific possible target. The target phase occurs between the capture and the bubbling phases.\n"},"handling-events/the-event-flow.html":{"url":"handling-events/the-event-flow.html","title":"The event flow","keywords":"","body":"The event flow \nOpenFL dispatches event objects whenever an event occurs. If the event target is not on the display list, OpenFL dispatches the event object directly to the event target. For example, OpenFL dispatches the progress event object directly to a URLStream object. If the event target is on the display list, however, OpenFL dispatches the event object into the display list, and the event object travels through the display list to the event target.\nThe event flow describes how an event object moves through the display list. The display list is organized in a hierarchy that can be described as a tree. At the top of the display list hierarchy is the Stage, which is a special display object container that serves as the root of the display list. The Stage is represented by the openfl.display.Stage class and can only be accessed through a display object. Every display object has a property named stage that refers to the Stage for that application.\nWhen OpenFL dispatches an event object for a display list-related event, that event object makes a round- trip journey from the Stage to the target node. The DOM Events Specification defines the target node as the node representing the event target. In other words, the target node is the display list object where the event occurred. For example, if a user clicks on a display list object named child1, OpenFL will dispatch an event object using child1 as the target node.\nThe event flow is conceptually divided into three parts. The first part is called the capture phase; this phase comprises all of the nodes from the Stage to the parent of the target node. The second part is called the target phase, which consists solely of the target node. The third part is called the bubbling phase. The bubbling phase comprises the nodes encountered on the return trip from the parent of the target node back to the Stage.\nThe names of the phases make more sense if you conceive of the display list as a vertical hierarchy with the Stage at the top, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nIf a user clicks on Child1 Node, OpenFL dispatches an event object into the event flow. As the following image shows, the object’s journey starts at Stage, moves down to Parent Node, then moves to Child1 Node, and then \"bubbles\" back up to Stage, moving through Parent Node again on its journey back to Stage.\n\nIn this example, the capture phase comprises Stage and Parent Node during the initial downward journey. The target phase comprises the time spent at Child1 Node. The bubbling phase comprises Parent Node and Stage as they are encountered during the upward journey back to the root node.\nThe ability to add event listeners along the event flow is useful when a user interface component comprises more than one object. For example, a button object often contains a text object that serves as the button’s label. Without the ability to add a listener to the event flow, you would have to add a listener to both the button object and the text object to ensure that you receive notification about click events that occur anywhere on the button. The existence of the event flow, however, allows you to place a single event listener on the button object that handles click events that occur either on the text object or on the areas of the button object that are not obscured by the text object.\nNot every event object, however, participates in all three phases of the event flow. Some types of events, such as the enterFrame and init event types, are dispatched directly to the target node and participate in neither the capture phase nor the bubbling phase. Other events may target objects that are not on the display list, such as events dispatched to an instance of the Socket class. These event objects will also flow directly to the target object, without participating in the capture and bubbling phases.\nTo find out how a particular event type behaves, you can either check the API documentation or examine the event object’s properties. Examining the event object’s properties is described in the following section.\n"},"handling-events/event-objects.html":{"url":"handling-events/event-objects.html","title":"Event objects","keywords":"","body":"Event objects \nEvent objects serve two main purposes in the new event-handling system. First, event objects represent actual events by storing information about specific events in a set of properties. Second, event objects contain a set of methods that allow you to manipulate event objects and affect the behavior of the event-handling system.\nTo facilitate access to these properties and methods, the OpenFL API defines an Event class that serves as the base class for all event objects. The Event class defines a fundamental set of properties and methods that are common to all event objects.\nThis section begins with a discussion of the Event class properties, continues with a description of the Event class methods, and concludes with an explanation of why subclasses of the Event class exist.\nUnderstanding Event class properties\nThe Event class defines a number of read-only properties and constants that provide important information about an event object.The following are especially important:\n\nEvent object types are represented by constants and stored in the Event.type property.\nWhether an event’s default behavior can be prevented is represented by a Boolean value and stored in the Event.cancelable property.\n\nEvent flow information is contained in the remaining properties.\n\n\nEvent object types\nEvery event object has an associated event type. Event types are stored in the Event.type property as string values. It is useful to know the type of an event object so that your code can distinguish objects of different types from one another. For example, the following code specifies that the clickHandler() listener function should respond to any mouse click event objects that are passed to myDisplayObject:\nmyDisplayObject.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\nSome two dozen event types are associated with the Event class itself and are represented by Event class constants, some of which are shown in the following excerpt from the Event class definition:\npackage openfl.events;\n\nclass Event {\n\n    // class constants\n\n    public static inline var ACTIVATE = \"activate\";\n    public static inline var ADDED = \"added\";\n\n    // remaining constants omitted for brevity\n\n}\n\nThese constants provide an easy way to refer to specific event types. You should use these constants instead of the strings they represent. If you misspell a constant name in your code, the compiler will catch the mistake, but if you instead use strings, a typographical error may not manifest at compile time and could lead to unexpected behavior that could be difficult to debug. For example, when adding an event listener, use the following code:\nmyDisplayObject.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\nrather than:\nmyDisplayObject.addEventListener (\"click\", clickHandler);\n\nDefault behavior information\nYour code can check whether the default behavior for any given event object can be prevented by accessing the cancelable property. The cancelable property holds a Boolean value that indicates whether or not a default behavior can be prevented. You can prevent, or cancel, the default behavior associated with a small number of events using the preventDefault() method. For more information, see Canceling default event behavior under Understanding Event class methods.\nEvent flow information\nThe remaining Event class properties contain important information about an event object and its relationship to the event flow, as described in the following list:\n\nThe bubbles property contains information about the parts of the event flow in which the event object participates.\nThe eventPhase property indicates the current phase in the event flow.\nThe target property stores a reference to the event target.\nThe currentTarget property stores a reference to the display list object that is currently processing the event object.\n\nThe bubbles property\nAn event is said to bubble if its event object participates in the bubbling phase of the event flow, which means that the event object is passed from the target node back through its ancestors until it reaches the Stage. The Event.bubbles property stores a Boolean value that indicates whether the event object participates in the bubbling phase. Because all events that bubble also participate in the capture and target phases, any event that bubbles participates in all three of the event flow phases. If the value is true, the event object participates in all three phases. If the value is false, the event object does not participate in the bubbling phase.\nThe eventPhase property\nYou can determine the event phase for any event object by investigating its eventPhase property. The eventPhase property contains an unsigned integer value that represents one of the three phases of the event flow. The OpenFL API defines a separate EventPhase class that contains three constants that correspond to the three unsigned integer values, as shown in the following code excerpt:\npackage openfl.events;\n\n@:enum abstract EventPhase(Int) from Int to Int from UInt to UInt {\n\n    public var AT_TARGET = 2;\n    public var BUBBLING_PHASE = 3;\n    public var CAPTURING_PHASE = 1;\n\n}\n\nThese constants correspond to the three valid values of the eventPhase property. You can use these constants to make your code more readable. For example, if you want to ensure that a function named myFunc() is called only if the event target is in the target stage, you can use the following code to test for this condition:\nif (event.eventPhase == EventPhase.AT_TARGET) {\n\n    myFunc ();\n\n}\n\nThe target property\nThe target property holds a reference to the object that is the target of the event. In some cases, this is straightforward, such as when a microphone becomes active, the target of the event object is the Microphone object. If the target is on the display list, however, the display list hierarchy must be taken into account. For example, if a user inputs a mouse click on a point that includes overlapping display list objects, OpenFL always choose the object that is farthest away from the Stage as the event target.\nFor complex projects, especially those in which buttons are routinely decorated with smaller child objects, the target property may not be used frequently because it will often point to a button’s child object instead of the button. In these situations, the common practice is to add event listeners to the button and use the currentTarget property because it points to the button, whereas the target property may point to a child of the button.\nThe currentTarget property\nThe currentTarget property contains a reference to the object that is currently processing the event object. Although it may seem odd not to know which node is currently processing the event object that you are examining, keep in mind that you can add a listener function to any display object in that event object's event flow, and the listener function can be placed in any location. Moreover, the same listener function can be added to different display objects. As a project increases in size and complexity, the currentTarget property becomes more and more useful.\nUnderstanding Event class methods \nThere are three categories of Event class methods:\n\nUtility methods, which can create copies of an event object or convert it to a string\nEvent flow methods, which remove event objects from the event flow\nDefault behavior methods, which prevent default behavior or check whether it has been prevented\n\nEvent class utility methods\nThere are two utility methods in the Event class. The clone() method allows you to create copies of an event object. The toString() method allows you to generate a string representation of the properties of an event object along with their values. Both of these methods are used internally by the event model system, but are exposed to developers for general use.\nFor advanced developers creating subclasses of the Event class, you must override and implement versions of both utility methods to ensure that the event subclass will work properly.\nStopping event flow\nYou can call either the Event.stopPropagation() method or the Event.stopImmediatePropagation() method to prevent an event object from continuing on its way through the event flow. The two methods are nearly identical and differ only in whether the current node’s other event listeners are allowed to execute:\n\nThe Event.stopPropagation() method prevents the event object from moving on to the next node, but only after any other event listeners on the current node are allowed to execute.\nThe Event.stopImmediatePropagation() method also prevents the event object from moving on to the next node, but does not allow any other event listeners on the current node to execute.\n\nCalling either of these methods has no effect on whether the default behavior associated with an event occurs. Use the default behavior methods of the Event class to prevent default behavior.\nCanceling default event behavior\nThe two methods that pertain to canceling default behavior are the preventDefault() method and the isDefaultPrevented() method. Call the preventDefault() method to cancel the default behavior associated with an event. To check whether preventDefault() has already been called on an event object, call the isDefaultPrevented() method, which returns a value of true if the method has already been called and false otherwise.\nThe preventDefault() method will work only if the event’s default behavior can be cancelled. You can check whether this is the case by referring to the API documentation for that event type, or by using Haxe to examine the cancelable property of the event object.\nCanceling the default behavior has no effect on the progress of an event object through the event flow. Use the event flow methods of the Event class to remove an event object from the event flow.\nSubclasses of the Event class \nFor many events, the common set of properties defined in the Event class is sufficient. Other events, however, have unique characteristics that cannot be captured by the properties available in the Event class. For these events, OpenFL defines several subclasses of the Event class.\nEach subclass provides additional properties and event types that are unique to that category of events. For example, events related to mouse input have several unique characteristics that cannot be captured by the properties defined in the Event class. The MouseEvent class extends the Event class by adding ten properties that contain information such as the location of the mouse event and whether specific keys were pressed during the mouse event.\nAn Event subclass also contains constants that represent the event types that are associated with the subclass. For example, the MouseEvent class defines constants for several mouse event types, include the click, doubleClick, mouseDown, and mouseUp event types.\nAs described in the section on Event class utility methods under Event objects, when creating an Event subclass you must override the clone() and toString() methods to provide functionality specific to the subclass.\n"},"handling-events/event-listeners.html":{"url":"handling-events/event-listeners.html","title":"Event listeners","keywords":"","body":"Event listeners \nEvent listeners, which are also called event handlers, are functions that OpenFL executes in response to specific events. Adding an event listener is a two-step process. First, you create a function or class method for OpenFL to execute in response to the event. This is sometimes called the listener function or the event handler function. Second, you use the addEventListener() method to register your listener function with the target of the event or any display list object that lies along the appropriate event flow.\nCreating a listener function\nThe creation of listener functions is one area where the OpenFL event model deviates from the DOM event model. In the DOM event model, there is a clear distinction between an event listener and a listener function: an event listener is an instance of a class that implements the EventListener interface, whereas a listener function is a method of that class named handleEvent(). In the DOM event model, you register the class instance that contains the listener function rather than the actual listener function.\nIn the OpenFL event model, there is no distinction between an event listener and a listener function. OpenFL does not have an EventListener interface, and listener functions can be defined outside a class or as part of a class. Moreover, listener functions do not have to be named handleEvent()—they can be named with any valid identifier. In OpenFL, you register the name of the actual listener function.\nListener function defined as a local function\nThe following code creates a simple project that displays a red square shape. A listener function named clickHandler(), which is not part of a class, listens for mouse click events on the red square.\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass ClickExample extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var child = new ChildSprite ();\n        addChild (child);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass ChildSprite extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\n        graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\n        graphics.endFill ();\n\n        var clickHandler = function (event:MouseEvent) {\n\n            trace (\"clickHandler detected an event of type: \" + event.type);\n            trace (\"the this keyword refers to: \" + this);\n\n        }\n\n        addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWhen a user interacts with the resulting project by clicking on the square, OpenFL generates the following trace output:\nclickHandler detected an event of type: click\nthe this keyword refers to: [object ChildSprite]\nNotice that the event object is passed as an argument to clickHandler(). This allows your listener function to examine the event object. In this example, you use the event object's type property to ascertain that the event is a click event.\nThe example also checks the value of the this keyword. In this case, this represents the Sprite object, because Haxe preserves the scope when creating functions.\nListener function defined as a class method\nThe following example is identical to the previous example that defines the ClickExample class except that the clickHandler() function is defined as a method of the ChildSprite class:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\nclass ClickExample extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var child = new ChildSprite ();\n        addChild (child);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass ChildSprite extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\n        graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\n        graphics.endFill ();\n\n        addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\n    }\n\n    private function clickHandler (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n        trace (\"clickHandler detected an event of type: \" + event.type);\n        trace (\"the this keyword refers to: \" + this);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWhen a user interacts with the resulting project by clicking on the red square, OpenFL generates the following trace output:\nclickHandler detected an event of type: click\nthe this keyword refers to: [object ChildSprite]\nManaging event listeners \nYou can manage your listener functions using the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface. The IEventDispatcher interface is the OpenFL version of the EventTarget interface of the DOM event model. Although the name IEventDispatcher may seem to imply that its main purpose is to send (or dispatch) event objects, the methods of this class are actually used much more frequently to register event listeners, check for event listeners, and remove event listeners. The IEventDispatcher interface defines five methods, as shown in the following code:\npackage openfl.events;\n\ninterface IEventDispatcher {\n\n    public function addEventListener (type:String, listener:Dynamic->Void, useCapture:Bool = false, priority:Int = 0, useWeakReference:Bool = false):Void;\n    public function dispatchEvent (event:Event):Bool;\n    public function hasEventListener (type:String):Bool;\n    public function removeEventListener (type:String, listener:Dynamic->Void, useCapture:Bool = false):Void;\n    public function willTrigger (type:String):Bool;\n\n}\n\nThe OpenFL API implements the IEventDispatcher interface with the EventDispatcher class, which serves as a base class for all classes that can be event targets or part of an event flow. For example, the DisplayObject class inherits from the EventDispatcher class. This means that any object on the display list has access to the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.\nAdding event listeners\nThe addEventListener() method is the workhorse of the IEventDispatcher interface. You use it to register your listener functions. The two required parameters are type and listener. You use the type parameter to specify the type of event. You use the listener parameter to specify the listener function that will execute when the event occurs. The listener parameter can be a reference to either a function or a class method.\nDo not use parentheses when you specify the listener parameter. For example, the clickHandler() function is specified without parentheses in the following call to the addEventListener() method:\naddEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler);\n\nThe useCapture parameter of the addEventListener() method allows you to control the event flow phase on which your listener will be active. If useCapture is set to true, your listener will be active during the capture phase of the event flow. If useCapture is set to false, your listener will be active during the target and bubbling phases of the event flow. To listen for an event during all phases of the event flow, you must call addEventListener() twice, once with useCapture set to true, and then again with useCapture set to false.\nThe priority parameter of the addEventListener() method is not an official part of the DOM Level 3 event model. It is included in OpenFL to provide you with more flexibility in organizing your event listeners. When you call addEventListener(), you can set the priority for that event listener by passing an integer value as the priority parameter. The default value is 0, but you can set it to negative or positive integer values. The higher the number, the sooner that event listener will be executed. Event listeners with the same priority are executed in the order that they were added, so the earlier a listener is added, the sooner it will be executed.\nThe useWeakReference parameter allows you to specify whether the reference to the listener function is weak or normal. Setting this parameter to true allows you to avoid situations in which listener functions persist in memory even though they are no longer needed. OpenFL use a technique called garbage collection to clear objects from memory that are no longer in use. An object is considered no longer in use if no references to it exist. The garbage collector disregards weak references, which means that a listener function that has only a weak reference pointing to it is eligible for garbage collection.\n\nThe useWeakReference parameter is currently disregarded, as JavaScript (and other OpenFL target platforms) do not support weak memory references. Do not rely upon this parameter—instead you should remove event listeners to allow garbage collection.\n\nRemoving event listeners\nYou can use the removeEventListener() method to remove an event listener that you no longer need. It is a good idea to remove any listeners that will no longer be used. Required parameters include the eventName and listener parameters, which are the same as the required parameters for the addEventListener() method. Recall that you can listen for events during all event phases by calling addEventListener() twice, once with useCapture set to true, and then again with it set to false. To remove both event listeners, you would need to call removeEventListener() twice, once with useCapture set to true, and then again with it set to false.\nDispatching events\nThe dispatchEvent() method can be used by advanced programmers to dispatch a custom event object into the event flow. The only parameter accepted by this method is a reference to an event object, which must be an instance of the Event class or a subclass of the Event class. Once dispatched, the target property of the event object is set to the object on which dispatchEvent() was called.\nChecking for existing event listeners\nThe final two methods of the IEventDispatcher interface provide useful information about the existence of event listeners. The hasEventListener() method returns true if an event listener is found for a specific event type on a particular display list object. The willTrigger() method also returns true if a listener is found for a particular display list object, but willTrigger() checks for listeners not only on that display object, but also on all of that display list object’s ancestors for all phases of the event flow.\nError events without listeners \nExceptions, rather than events, are the primary mechanism for error handling in Haxe, but exception handling does not work for asynchronous operations such as loading files. If an error occurs during such an asynchronous operation, OpenFL dispatches an error event object. If you do not create a listener for the error event, the debugger versions of Flash Player will bring up a dialog box with information about the error, or messages will be displayed in console output on other platforms. For example, the debugger version of Flash Player produces the following dialog box describing the error when the application attempts to load a file from an invalid URL:\n\nMost error events are based on the ErrorEvent class, and as such will have a property named text that is used to store the error message that OpenFL displays. The two exceptions are the StatusEvent and NetStatusEvent classes. Both of these classes have a level property (StatusEvent.level and NetStatusEvent.info.level).\nWhen the value of the level property is \"error\", these event types are considered to be error events.\nAn error event will not cause dynamic platforms (such as HTML5 or Flash Player) to stop running, but will stop execution on all other platforms. It will manifest as a dialog box on the debugger versions of Flash Player, and will not manifest in release versions of Flash Player.\n"},"display-programming/":{"url":"display-programming/","title":"Chapter 2: Display programming","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 2: Display programming \nVisual elements are programmed in Haxe by working with display objects on the display stage. For example, you can add, move, remove, and order display objects, apply filters and masks, draw vector and bitmap graphics, and perform three-dimensional transformations using the OpenFL display programming API. The primary classes used for display programming are part of the openfl.display package.\n"},"display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html":{"url":"display-programming/basics-of-display-programming.html","title":"Basics of display programming","keywords":"","body":"Basics of display programming \nEach application built with OpenFL has a hierarchy of displayed objects known as the display list, illustrated below. The display list contains all the visible elements in the application.\n\nAs the illustration shows, display elements fall into one or more of the following groups:\n\nThe Stage\nThe Stage is the base container of display objects. Each application has one Stage object, which contains all on-screen display objects. The Stage is the top-level container and is at the top of the display list hierarchy:\nEach project has an associated Haxe class, known as the main class of the project. When a project opens, OpenFL calls the constructor function for that class and the instance that is created (which is always a type of display object) is added as a child of the Stage object. The main class of a project always extends the Sprite class (for more information, see Advantages of the display list approach.\nYou can access the Stage through the stage property of any DisplayObject instance. For more information, see Setting Stage properties.\n\nDisplay objects\nIn Haxe, all elements that appear on screen in an application are types of display objects. The openfl.display package includes a DisplayObject class, which is a base class extended by a number of other classes. These different classes represent different types of display objects, such as vector shapes, movie clips, and text fields, to name a few. For an overview of these classes, see Advantages of the display list approach.\n\nDisplay object containers\nDisplay object containers are special types of display objects that, in addition to having their own visual representation, can also contain child objects that are also display objects.\nThe DisplayObjectContainer class is a subclass of the DisplayObject class. A DisplayObjectContainer object can contain multiple display objects in its childlist. For example, the following illustration shows a type of DisplayObjectContainer object known as a Sprite that contains various display objects:\n\nA. A SimpleButton object. This type of display object has different \"up,\" \"down,\" and \"over\" states. B. A Bitmap object. In this case, the Bitmap object was loaded from an external JPEG through a Loader object. C. A Shape object. The \"picture frame\" contains a rounded rectangle that is drawn in Haxe. This Shape object has a Drop Shadow filter applied to it. D. A TextField object.\nIn the context of discussing display objects, DisplayObjectContainer objects are also known as display object containers or simply containers. As noted earlier, the Stage is a display object container.\nAlthough all visible display objects inherit from the DisplayObject class, the type of each is of a specific subclass of DisplayObject class. For example, there is a constructor function for the Shape class or the Video class, but there is no constructor function for the DisplayObject class.\n\n\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter when programming OpenFL graphics:\nAlpha The color value representing the amount of transparency (or more correctly, the amount of opacity) in a color. For example, a color with an alpha channel value of 60% only shows 60% of its full strength, and is 40% transparent.\nBitmap graphic A graphic that is defined in the computer as a grid (rows and columns) of colored pixels. Commonly bitmap graphics include digital photos and similar images.\nBlending mode A specification of how the contents of two overlapping images should interact. Commonly an opaque image on top of another image simply blocks the image underneath so that it isn’t visible at all; however, different blending modes cause the colors of the images to blend together in different ways so the resulting content is some combination of the two images.\nDisplay list The hierarchy of display objects that will be rendered as visible screen content by OpenFL. The Stage is the root of the display list, and all the display objects that are attached to the Stage or one of its children form the display list (even if the object isn’t actually rendered, for example if it’s outside the boundaries of the Stage).\nDisplay object An object which represents some type of visual content in OpenFL. Only display objects can be included in the display list, and all display object classes are subclasses of the DisplayObject class.\nDisplay object container A special type of display object which can contain child display objects in addition to (generally) having its own visual representation.\nMain class of the project The class that defines the behavior for the outermost display object in a project, which conceptually is the class for the project itself. This is the entry point for each project.\nMasking A technique of hiding from view certain parts of an image (or conversely, only allowing certain parts of an image to display). The portions of the mask image become transparent, so content underneath shows through. The term is related to painter’s masking tape that is used to prevent paint from being applied to certain areas.\nStage The visual container that is the base or background of all visual content in a SWF.\nTransformation An adjustment to a visual characteristic of a graphic, such as rotating the object, altering its scale, skewing or distorting its shape, or altering its color.\nVector graphic A graphic that is defined in the computer as lines and shapes drawn with particular characteristics (such as thickness, length, size, angle, and position).\n"},"display-programming/core-display-classes.html":{"url":"display-programming/core-display-classes.html","title":"Core display classes","keywords":"","body":"Core display classes \nThe openfl.display package includes classes for visual objects that can appear in OpenFL.

For more information, see Properties and methods of the DisplayObject class.\nYou can instantiate objects of the following classes contained in the openfl.display package:\n\nBitmap—You use the Bitmap class to define bitmap objects, either loaded from external files or rendered through Haxe. You can load bitmaps from external files through the Loader class. You can load GIF, JPG, or PNG files. You can also create a BitmapData object with custom data and then create a Bitmap object that uses that data. You can use the methods of the BitmapData class to alter bitmaps, whether they are loaded or created in Haxe. For more information, see Loading display objects and Working with bitmaps.\n\nLoader—You use the Loader class to load external assets (either projects or graphics). For more information, see Loading display content dynamically.\n\nShape—You use the Shape class to create vector graphics, such as rectangles, lines, circles, and so on. For more information, see Using the drawing API.\n\nSimpleButton—A SimpleButton object is the OpenFL representation of a button symbol created in the Flash authoring tool. A SimpleButton instance has four button states: up, down, over, and hit test (the area that responds to mouse and keyboard events).\n\nSprite—A Sprite object can contain graphics of its own, and it can contain child display objects.

Instead, they serve as parent classes for other display objects, combining common functionality into a single class.\n\n\nInteractiveObject—InteractiveObject is the base class for all objects used to interact with the mouse and keyboard. SimpleButton, TextField, Loader, Sprite, Stage, and MovieClip objects are all subclasses of the InteractiveObject class. For more information on creating mouse and keyboard interaction, see Basics of user interaction.\n\nMorphShape—These objects are created when you create a shape tween in the Flash authoring tool. You cannot instantiate them using Haxe, but they can be accessed from the display list.\n\nStage—The Stage class extends the DisplayObjectContainer class.

In ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, many of the same types of objects are all included in one class: the MovieClip class.\nThis individualization of classes and the hierarchical structure of display lists have the following benefits:\n\nMore efficient rendering and reduced memory usage\nImproved depth management\nFull traversal of the display list\nOff-list display objects\nEasier subclassing of display objects\n\nMore efficient rendering and smaller file sizes\nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, you could draw shapes only in a MovieClip object. In OpenFL, there are simpler display object classes in which you can draw shapes. Because these OpenFL display object classes do not include the full set of methods and properties that a MovieClip object includes, they are less taxing on memory and processor resources.\nFor example, each MovieClip object includes properties for the timeline of the movie clip, whereas a Shape object does not. The properties for managing the timeline can use a lot of memory and processor resources. In OpenFL, using the Shape object results in better performance. The Shape object has less overhead than the more complex MovieClip object. OpenFL does not need to manage unused MovieClip properties, which improves speed and reduces the memory footprint the object uses.\nImproved depth management \nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, depth was managed through a linear depth management scheme and methods such as getNextHighestDepth().\nOpenFL includes the DisplayObjectContainer class, which has more convenient methods and properties for managing the depth of display objects.\nIn OpenFL, when you move a display object to a new position in the child list of a DisplayObjectContainer instance, the other children in the display object container are repositioned automatically and assigned appropriate child index positions in the display object container.\nAlso, in OpenFL it is always possible to discover all of the child objects of any display object container. Every DisplayObjectContainer instance has a numChildren property, which lists the number of children in the display object container. And since the child list of a display object container is always an indexed list, you can examine every object in the list from index position 0 through the last index position (numChildren - 1). This was not possible with the methods and properties of a MovieClip object in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0.\nIn OpenFL, you can easily traverse the display list sequentially; there are no gaps in the index numbers of a child list of a display object container. Traversing the display list and managing the depth of objects is much easier than was possible in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. In ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, a movie clip could contain objects with intermittent gaps in the depth order, which could make it difficult to traverse the list of object. In OpenFL, each child list of a display object container is cached internally as an array, resulting in very fast lookups (by index). Looping through all children of a display object container is also very fast.\nIn OpenFL, you can also access children in a display object container by using the getChildByName() method of the DisplayObjectContainer class.\nFull traversal of the display list \nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, you could not access some objects, such as vector shapes, that were drawn in the Flash authoring tool. In OpenFL, you can access all objects on the display list—both those created using OpenFL and all display objects created in the Flash authoring tool. For details, see Traversing the display list.\nOff-list display objects \nIn OpenFL, you can create display objects that are not on the visible display list. These are known as off-list display objects. A display object is added to the visible display list only when you call the addChild() or addChildAt() method of a DisplayObjectContainer instance that has already been added to the display list.\nYou can use off-list display objects to assemble complex display objects, such as those that have multiple display object containers containing multiple display objects. By keeping display objects off-list, you can assemble complicated objects without using the processing time to render these display objects. You can then add an off-list display object to the display list when it is needed. Also, you can move a child of a display object container on and off the display list and to any desired position in the display list at will.\nEasier subclassing of display objects \nIn ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, you would often have to add new MovieClip objects to a project to create basic shapes or to display bitmaps. In OpenFL, the DisplayObject class includes many built-in subclasses, including Shape and Bitmap. Because the classes in OpenFL are more specialized for specific types of objects, it is easier to create basic subclasses of the built-in classes.\nFor example, in order to draw a circle in ActionScript 2.0, you could create a CustomCircle class that extends the MovieClip class when an object of the custom class is instantiated. However, that class would also include a number of properties and methods from the MovieClip class (such as totalFrames) that do not apply to the class. In OpenFL, however, you can create a CustomCircle class that extends the Shape object, and as such does not include the unrelated properties and methods that are contained in the MovieClip class. The following code shows an example of a CustomCircle class:\nimport openfl.display.*;\n\nclass CustomCircle extends Shape {\n\n    private var xPos:Float;\n    private var yPos:Float;\n    private var radius:Float;\n    private var color:Int;\n\n    public function new (xInput:Float, yInput:Float, rInput:Float, colorInput:Int) {\n\n        xPos = xInput;\n        yPos = yInput;\n        radius = rInput;\n        color = colorInput;\n\n        this.graphics.beginFill (color);\n        this.graphics.drawCircle (xPos, yPos, radius);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/","title":"Working with display objects","keywords":"","body":"Working with display objects \nNow that you understand the basic concepts of the Stage, display objects, display object containers, and the display list, this section provides you with some more specific information about working with display objects in OpenFL.\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/properties-and-methods-of-the-displayobject-class.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/properties-and-methods-of-the-displayobject-class.html","title":"Properties and methods of the DisplayObject class","keywords":"","body":"Properties and methods of the DisplayObject class \nAll display objects are subclasses of the DisplayObject class, and as such they inherit the properties and methods of the DisplayObject class.

For example, each display object has an x property and a y property that specifies the object’s position in its display object container.\nYou cannot create a DisplayObject instance using the DisplayObject class constructor. You must create another type of object (an object that is a subclass of the DisplayObject class), such as a Sprite, to instantiate an object with the new operator. Also, if you want to create a custom display object class, you must create a subclass of one of the display object subclasses that has a usable constructor function (such as the Shape class or the Sprite class).

For example, in the following code, the myText TextField object would not be visible if you omitted the last line of code. In the last line of code, the this keyword must refer to a display object container that is already added to the display list.\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.text.TextField;\n\n...\n\nvar myText = new TextField ();\nmyText.text = \"Buenos dias.\";\nthis.addChild (myText);\n\nWhen you add any visual element to the Stage, that element becomes a child of the Stage object. The first project loaded in an application (for example, the one that you embed in an HTML page) is automatically added as a child of the Stage. It can be an object of any type that extends the Sprite class.\nAny display objects that you create without using Haxe—for example, by placing an item on the Stage in Adobe Animate—are added to the display list. Although you do not add these display objects through Haxe, you can access them through Haxe. For example, the following code adjusts the width of an object named button1 that was added in the authoring tool (not through Haxe):\nbutton1.width = 200;\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/working-with-display-object-containers.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/working-with-display-object-containers.html","title":"Working with display object containers","keywords":"","body":"Working with display object containers \nIf a DisplayObjectContainer object is deleted from the display list, or if it is moved or transformed in some other way, each display object in the DisplayObjectContainer is also deleted, moved, or transformed.\nA display object container is itself a type of display object—it can be added to another display object container. For example, the following image shows a display object container, pictureScreen, that contains one outline shape and four other display object containers (of type PictureFrame):\n\nA. A shape defining the border of the pictureScreen display object container B. Four display object containers that are children of the pictureScreen object\nIn order to have a display object appear in the display list, you must add it to a display object container that is on the display list. You do this by using the addChild() method or the addChildAt() method of the container object. For example, without the final line of the following code, the myTextField object would not be displayed:\nvar myTextField = new TextField ();\nmyTextField.text = \"hello\";\nthis.root.addChild (myTextField);\n\nIn this code sample, this.root points to the MovieClip display object container that contains the code. In your actual code, you may specify a different container.\nUse the addChildAt() method to add the child to a specific position in the child list of the display object container. These zero-based index positions in the child list relate to the layering (the front-to-back order) of the display objects. For example, consider the following three display objects. Each object was created from a custom class called Ball.\n\nThe layering of these display objects in their container can be adjusted using the addChildAt() method. For example, consider the following code:\nball_A = new Ball (0xFFCC00, \"a\");\nball_A.name = \"ball_A\";\nball_A.x = 20;\nball_A.y = 20;\ncontainer.addChild (ball_A);\n\nball_B = new Ball (0xFFCC00, \"b\");\nball_B.name = \"ball_B\";\nball_B.x = 70;\nball_B.y = 20;\ncontainer.addChild (ball_B);\n\nball_C = new Ball (0xFFCC00, \"c\");\nball_C.name = \"ball_C\";\nball_C.x = 40;\nball_C.y = 60;\ncontainer.addChildAt (ball_C, 1);\n\nAfter executing this code, the display objects are positioned as follows in the container DisplayObjectContainer object. Notice the layering of the objects.\n\nTo reposition an object to the top of the display list, simply re-add it to the list. For example, after the previous code, to move ball_A to the top of the stack, use this line of code:\ncontainer.addChild (ball_A);\n\nThis code effectively removes ball_A from its location in container’s display list, and re-adds it to the top of the list—which has the end result of moving it to the top of the stack.\nYou can use the getChildAt() method to verify the layer order of the display objects. The getChildAt() method returns child objects of a container based on the index number you pass it. For example, the following code reveals names of display objects at different positions in the child list of the container DisplayObjectContainer object:\ntrace (container.getChildAt (0).name); // ball_A\ntrace (container.getChildAt (1).name); // ball_C\ntrace (container.getChildAt (2).name); // ball_B\n\nIf you remove a display object from the parent container’s child list, the higher elements on the list each move down a position in the child index. For example, continuing with the previous code, the following code shows how the display object that was at position 2 in the container DisplayObjectContainer moves to position 1 if a display object that is lower in the child list is removed:\ncontainer.removeChild (ball_C);\ntrace (container.getChildAt (0).name); // ball_A\ntrace (container.getChildAt (1).name); // ball_B\n\nThe removeChild() and removeChildAt() methods do not delete a display object instance entirely. They simply remove it from the child list of the container. The instance can still be referenced by another variable. \nBecause a display object has only one parent container, you can add an instance of a display object to only one display object container. For example, the following code shows that the display object tf1 can exist in only one container (in this case, a Sprite, which extends the DisplayObjectContainer class):\ntf1 = new TextField ();\ntf2 = new TextField ();\ntf1.name = \"text 1\";\ntf2.name = \"text 2\";\n\ncontainer1 = new Sprite ();\ncontainer2 = new Sprite ();\n\ncontainer1.addChild (tf1);\ncontainer1.addChild (tf2);\ncontainer2.addChild (tf1);\n\ntrace (container1.numChildren); // 1\ntrace (container1.getChildAt (0).name); // text 2\ntrace (container2.numChildren); // 1\ntrace (container2.getChildAt(0).name); // text 1\n\nIf you add a display object that is contained in one display object container to another display object container, it is removed from the first display object container’s child list.\nIn addition to the methods described above, the DisplayObjectContainer class defines several methods for working with child display objects, including the following:\n\ncontains(): Determines whether a display object is a child of a DisplayObjectContainer.\ngetChildByName(): Retrieves a display object by name.\ngetChildIndex(): Returns the index position of a display object.\nsetChildIndex(): Changes the position of a child display object.\nremoveChildren(): Removes multiple child display objects.\nswapChildren(): Swaps the front-to-back order of two display objects.\nswapChildrenAt(): Swaps the front-to-back order of two display objects, specified by their index values. \n\nFor more information, see the relevant entries in the API Reference.\nRecall that a display object that is off the display list—one that is not included in a display object container that is a child of the Stage—is known as an off-list display object.\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/traversing-the-display-list.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/traversing-the-display-list.html","title":"Traversing the display list","keywords":"","body":"Traversing the display list \nAs you’ve seen, the display list is a tree structure. At the top of the tree is the Stage, which can contain multiple display objects. Those display objects that are themselves display object containers can contain other display objects, or display object containers.\n\nThe DisplayObjectContainer class includes properties and methods for traversing the display list, by means of the child lists of display object containers. For example, consider the following code, which adds two display objects, title and pict, to the container object (which is a Sprite, and the Sprite class extends the DisplayObjectContainer class):\nvar container = new Sprite();\n\nvar title = new TextField ();\ntitle.text = \"Hello\";\n\nvar pict = new Loader ();\nvar url = new URLRequest (\"banana.jpg\");\npict.load (url);\npict.name = \"banana loader\";\n\ncontainer.addChild (title);\ncontainer.addChild (pict);\n\nThe getChildAt() method returns the child of the display list at a specific index position:\ntrace (Std.is (container.getChildAt (0), TextField)); // true\n\nYou can also access child objects by name. Each display object has a name property, and if you don’t assign it, OpenFL assigns a default value, such as \"instance1\". For example, the following code shows how to use the getChildByName() method to access a child display object with the name \"banana loader\":\ntrace (Std.is (container.getChildByName (\"banana\"), Loader)); // true\n\nUsing the getChildByName() method can result in slower performance than using the getChildAt() method.\nSince a display object container can contain other display object containers as child objects in its display list, you can traverse the full display list of the application as a tree. For example, in the code excerpt shown earlier, once the load operation for the pict Loader object is complete, the pict object will have one child display object, which is the bitmap, loaded. To access this bitmap display object, you can write pict.getChildAt (0). You can also write container.getChildAt (0).getChildAt (0) (since container.getChildAt (0) == pict).\nThe following function provides an indented trace() output of the display list from a display object container:\npublic function traceDisplayList (container:DisplayObjectContainer, indentString:String = \"\"):Void {\n\n    var child:DisplayObject;\n\n    for (i in 0...container.numChildren) {\n\n        child = container.getChildAt (i);\n        trace (indentString + child + child.name);\n\n        if (Std.is (container.getChildAt (i), DisplayObjectContainer)) {\n\n            traceDisplayList (cast (child, DisplayObjectContainer), indentString + \"    \");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/setting-stage-properties.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/setting-stage-properties.html","title":"Setting Stage properties","keywords":"","body":"Setting Stage properties \nThe Stage class overrides most properties and methods of the DisplayObject class. If you call one of these overridden properties or methods, OpenFL will ignore the request. For example, the Stage object does not have x or y properties, since its position is fixed as the main container for the application. The x and y properties refer to the position of a display object relative to its container, and since the Stage is not contained in another display object container, these properties do not apply.\n\nControlling the playback frame rate\nThe frameRate property of the Stage class is used to set the frame rate for all projects loaded into the application. For more information, see the API Reference.\nControlling Stage scaling\nWhen the portion of the screen representing OpenFL is resized, the runtime automatically adjusts the Stage contents to compensate. The Stage class’s scaleMode property determines how the Stage contents are adjusted. This property can be set to four different values, defined as constants in the openfl.display.StageScaleMode class:\n\nStageScaleMode.EXACT_FIT scales the project to fill the new stage dimensions without regard for the original content aspect ratio. The scale factors might not be the same for width and height, so the content can appear squeezed or stretched if the aspect ratio of the stage is changed.\nStageScaleMode.SHOW_ALL scales the project to fit entirely within the new stage dimensions without changing the content aspect ratio. This scale mode displays all of the content, but can result in \"letterbox\" borders, like the black bars that appear when viewing a wide-screen movie on a standard television.\nStageScaleMode.NO_BORDER scales the project to entirely fill the new stage dimensions without changing the aspect ratio of the content. This scale mode makes full use of the stage display area, but can result in cropping.\nStageScaleMode.NO_SCALE — does not scale the project. If the new stage dimensions are smaller, the content is cropped; if larger, the added space is blank.\n\n\nOn Flash Player, OpenFL will respect the above StageScaleMode settings, but on other platforms, OpenFL will behave like StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE by default, or StageScaleMode.SHOW_ALL if you set a window width and height in your project file\n\nIn the StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE scale mode only, the stageWidth and stageHeight properties of the Stage class can be used to determine the actual pixel dimensions of the resized stage. (In the other scale modes, the stageWidth and stageHeight properties always reflect the original width and height of the project.) In addition, when scaleMode is set to StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE and the project is resized, the Stage class’s resize event is dispatched, allowing you to make adjustments accordingly.\nConsequently, having scaleMode set to StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE allows you to have greater control over how the screen contents adjust to the window resizing if you desire. For example, in a project containing a video and a control bar, you might want to make the control bar stay the same size when the Stage is resized, and only change the size of the video window to accommodate the Stage size change. This is demonstrated in the following example:\n// mainContent is a display object containing the main content;\n// it is positioned at the top-left corner of the Stage, and\n// it should resize when the window resizes.\n// controlBar is a display object (e.g. a Sprite) containing several\n// buttons; it should stay positioned at the bottom-left corner of the\n// Stage (below mainContent) and it should not resize when the project\n// resizes.\n\nimport openfl.display.Stage;\nimport openfl.display.StageAlign;\nimport openfl.display.StageScaleMode;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\n\n...\n\nvar stage = mainContent.stage;\nstage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;\nstage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;\nstage.addEventListener (Event.RESIZE, resizeDisplay);\n\n...\n\nprivate function resizeDisplay (event:Event):Void {\n\n    var width = stage.stageWidth;\n    var height = stage.stageHeight;\n\n    // Resize the main content area\n    var newContentHeight = height - controlBar.height;\n    mainContent.height = newContentHeight;\n    mainContent.scaleX = mainContent.scaleY;\n\n    // Reposition the control bar\n    controlBar.y = newContentHeight;\n\n}\n\nWorking with full-screen mode\nFull-screen mode allows you to set a movie’s stage to fill a viewer’s entire monitor without any container borders or menus. The Stage class’s displayState property is used to toggle full-screen mode on and off for an OpenFL project. The displayState property can be set to one of the values defined by the constants in the openfl.display.StageDisplayState class. To turn on full-screen mode, set the displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN:\nstage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN;\n\nTo turn on full-screen interactive mode, set the displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE:\nstage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE;\n\n\nOpenFL allows interactive access for both StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN or StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE on platforms other than Flash\n\nIn Flash Player, full-screen mode can only be initiated through Haxe in response to a mouse click (including right-click) or keypress. Other platforms content do not require that full-screen mode be entered in response to a user gesture.\nTo exit full-screen mode, set the displayState property to StageDisplayState.NORMAL.\nstage.displayState = StageDisplayState.NORMAL;\n\nIn addition, a user can choose to leave full-screen mode by switching focus to a different window or by using one of several key combinations: the Esc key (all platforms), Control-W (Windows), Command-W (Mac), or Alt-F4 (Windows).\nEnabling full-screen mode in Flash Player\nTo enable full-screen mode for a SWF embedded in an HTML page, the HTML code to embed the SWF file must include a param tag and embed attribute with the name allowFullScreen and value true, like this:\n\n    ...\n    \n    \n\n\nIn the Flash authoring tool, select File -> Publish Settings and in the Publish Settings dialog box, on the HTML tab, select the Flash Only - Allow Full Screen template.\nIf you are using JavaScript in a web page to generate the SWF-embedding tags, you must alter the JavaScript to add the allowFullScreen param tag and attribute. For example, if your HTML page uses the AC_FL_RunContent() function (which is used in HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and Flash Builder), you should add the allowFullScreen parameter to that function call as follows:\nAC_FL_RunContent(\n    ...\n    'allowFullScreen','true',\n    ...\n); //end AC code\n\nThis does not apply to projects running in the stand-alone Flash Player.\nNote: If you set the Window Mode (wmode in the HTML) to Opaque Windowless (opaque) or Transparent Windowless (transparent), the full-screen window is always opaque\n\nEnabling full-screen interactive mode in Flash Player 11.3 and higher\nFlash Player 11.3 and higher support full-screen interactive mode, which enables full support for all keyboard keys (except for Esc, which exits full-screen interactive mode). Full-screen interactive mode is useful for gaming (for example, to enable chat in a multi-player game or WASD keyboard controls in a first-person shooter game.)\nTo enable full-screen interactive mode for a project embedded in an HTML page, the HTML code to embed the SWF file must include a param tag and embed attribute with the name allowFullScreenInteractive and value true, like this:\n\n    ...\n    \n    \n\n\nIn the Flash authoring tool, select File -> Publish Settings and in the Publish Settings dialog box, on the HTML tab, select the Flash Only - Allow Full Screen Interactive template.\nIf you are using JavaScript in a web page to generate the SWF-embedding tags, you must alter the JavaScript to add the allowFullScreenInteractive param tag and attribute. For example, if your HTML page uses the AC_FL_RunContent() function (which is used in HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and Flash Builder), you should add the allowFullScreenInteractive parameter to that function call as follows:\nAC_FL_RunContent(\n    ...\n    'allowFullScreenInteractive','true',\n    ...\n); //end AC code\n\nThis does not apply to projects running in the stand-alone Flash Player.\nFull screen stage size and scaling\nThe Stage.fullScreenHeight and Stage.fullScreenWidth properties return the height and the width of the monitor that’s used when going to full-screen size, if that state is entered immediately. These values can be incorrect if the user has the opportunity to move the browser from one monitor to another after you retrieve these values but before entering full-screen mode. If you retrieve these values in the same event handler where you set the Stage.displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN, the values are correct. For users with multiple monitors, the content expands to fill only one monitor. OpenFL uses a metric to determine which monitor contains the greatest portion of the application window, and uses that monitor for full-screen mode. The fullScreenHeight and fullScreenWidth properties only reflect the size of the monitor that is used for full-screen mode. For more information, see Stage.fullScreenHeight and Stage.fullScreenWidth in the API Reference.\nStage scaling behavior for full-screen mode is the same as under normal mode; the scaling is controlled by the Stage class’s scaleMode property. If the scaleMode property is set to StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE, the Stage’s stageWidth and stageHeight properties change to reflect the size of the screen area occupied by the content (the entire screen, in this case); if viewed in the browser the HTML parameter for this controls the setting.\nYou can use the Stage class’s fullScreen event to detect and respond when full-screen mode is turned on or off. For example, you might want to reposition, add, or remove items from the screen when entering or leaving full-screen mode, as in this example:\nimport openfl.events.FullScreenEvent;\n\n...\n\nprivate function fullScreenRedraw (event:FullScreenEvent):Void {\n\n    if (event.fullScreen) {\n\n        // Remove input text fields.\n        // Add a button that closes full-screen mode.\n\n    } else {\n\n        // Re-add input text fields.\n        // Remove the button that closes full-screen mode.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n...\n\nmySprite.stage.addEventListener (FullScreenEvent.FULL_SCREEN, fullScreenRedraw);\n\nAs this code shows, the event object for the fullScreen event is an instance of the openfl.events.FullScreenEvent class, which includes a fullScreen property indicating whether full-screen mode is enabled (true) or not (false).\nKeyboard support in full-screen mode\nWhen Flash Player runs in a browser, all keyboard-related code, such as keyboard events and text entry in TextField instances, is disabled in full-screen mode. The exceptions (the keys that are enabled) are:\n\nSelected non-printing keys, specifically the arrow keys, space bar, and tab key\nKeyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode: Esc (Windows and Mac), Control-W (Windows), Command- W (Mac), and Alt-F4\n\nThese restrictions are not present for Flash content running in the stand-alone Flash Player.\n"},"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/handling-events-for-display-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/working-with-display-objects/handling-events-for-display-objects.html","title":"Handling events for display objects","keywords":"","body":"Handling events for display objects \nThe DisplayObject class inherits from the EventDispatcher class. This means that every display object can participate fully in the event model (described in Handling events). Every display object can use its addEventListener() method—inherited from the EventDispatcher class—to listen for a particular event, but only if the listening object is part of the event flow for that event.\nWhen OpenFL dispatches an event object, that event object makes a round-trip journey from the Stage to the display object where the event occurred. For example, if a user clicks on a display object named child1, OpenFL dispatches an event object from the Stage through the display list hierarchy down to the child1 display object.\nThe event flow is conceptually divided into three phases, as illustrated in this diagram:\n\nFor more information, see Handling events.\nOne important issue to keep in mind when working with display object events is the effect that event listeners can have on whether display objects are automatically removed from memory (garbage collected) when they’re removed from the display list.

Because all display objects inherit this functionality from their common base class (DisplayObject), this functionality behaves the same whether you’re manipulating a TextField instance, a Video instance, a Shape instance, or any other display object. The following sections detail several of these common display object manipulations.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/changing-position.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/changing-position.html","title":"Changing position","keywords":"","body":"Changing position\nThe most basic manipulation to any display object is positioning it on the screen. To set a display object’s position, change the object’s x and y properties.\nmyShape.x = 17;\nmyShape.y = 212;\n\nThe display object positioning system treats the Stage as a Cartesian coordinate system (the common grid system with a horizontal x axis and vertical y axis). The origin of the coordinate system (the 0,0 coordinate where the x and y axes meet) is at the top-left corner of the Stage. From there, x values are positive going right and negative going left, while (in contrast to typical graphing systems) y values are positive going down and negative going up. For example, the previous lines of code move the object myShape to the x coordinate 17 (17 pixels to the right of the origin) and y coordinate 212 (212 pixels below the origin).\nBy default, when a display object is created using Haxe, the x and y properties are both set to 0, placing the object at the top-left corner of its parent content.\nChanging position relative to the Stage\nIt’s important to remember that the x and y properties always refer to the position of the display object relative to the 0,0 coordinate of its parent display object’s axes. So for a Shape instance (such as a circle) contained inside a Sprite instance, setting the Shape object’s x and y properties to 0 will place the circle at the top-left corner of the Sprite, which is not necessarily the top-left corner of the Stage. To position an object relative to the global Stage coordinates, you can use the globalToLocal() method of any display object to convert coordinates from global (Stage) coordinates to local (display object container) coordinates, like this:\n// Position the shape at the top-left corner of the Stage,\n// regardless of where its parent is located.\n\n// Create a Sprite, positioned at x:200 and y:200.\nvar mySprite = new Sprite ();\nmySprite.x = 200;\nmySprite.y = 200;\nthis.addChild (mySprite);\n\n// Draw a dot at the Sprite's 0,0 coordinate, for reference.\nmySprite.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\nmySprite.graphics.beginFill (0x000000);\nmySprite.graphics.moveTo (0, 0);\nmySprite.graphics.lineTo (1, 0);\nmySprite.graphics.lineTo (1, 1);\nmySprite.graphics.lineTo (0, 1);\nmySprite.graphics.endFill ();\n\n// Create the circle Shape instance.\nvar circle = new Shape ();\nmySprite.addChild (circle);\n\n// Draw a circle with radius 50 and center point at x:50, y:50 in the Shape. circle.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\ncircle.graphics.beginFill (0xff0000);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle (50, 50, 50);\ncircle.graphics.endFill ();\n\n// Move the Shape so its top-left corner is at the Stage's 0, 0 coordinate.\nvar stagePoint = new Point (0, 0);\nvar targetPoint = mySprite.globalToLocal (stagePoint);\ncircle.x = targetPoint.x;\ncircle.y = targetPoint.y;\n\nYou can likewise use the DisplayObject class’s localToGlobal() method to convert local coordinates to Stage coordinates.\nMoving display objects with the mouse\nYou can let a user move display objects with mouse using two different techniques in Haxe. In both cases, two mouse events are used: when the mouse button is pressed down, the object is told to follow the mouse cursor, and when it’s released, the object is told to stop following the mouse cursor.\n\nThe first technique, using the startDrag() method, is simpler, but more limited. When the mouse button is pressed, the startDrag() method of the display object to be dragged is called. When the mouse button is released, the stopDrag() method is called. The Sprite class defines these two functions, so the object moved must be a Sprite or one of its subclasses.\n// This code creates a mouse drag interaction using the startDrag()\n// technique.\n// square is a MovieClip or Sprite instance.\n\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is pressed.\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.startDrag ();\n\n}\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is released.\nprivate function stopDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.stopDrag ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging);\nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\nThis technique suffers from one fairly significant limitation: only one item at a time can be dragged using startDrag(). If one display object is being dragged and the startDrag() method is called on another display object, the first display object stops following the mouse immediately. For example, if the startDragging() function is changed as shown here, only the circle object will be dragged, in spite of the square.startDrag() method call:\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.startDrag ();\n    circle.startDrag ();\n\n}\n\nAs a consequence of the fact that only one object can be dragged at a time using startDrag(), the stopDrag() method can be called on any display object and it stops whatever object is currently being dragged.\nIf you need to drag more than one display object, or to avoid the possibility of conflicts where more than one object might potentially use startDrag(), it’s best to use the mouse-following technique to create the dragging effect. With this technique, when the mouse button is pressed, a function is subscribed as a listener to the mouseMove event of the Stage. This function, which is then called every time the mouse moves, causes the dragged object to jump to the x, y coordinate of the mouse. Once the mouse button is released, the function is unsubscribed as a listener, meaning it is no longer called when the mouse moves and the object stops following the mouse cursor. Here is some code that demonstrates this technique:\n// This code moves display objects using the mouse-following\n// technique.\n// circle is a DisplayObject (e.g. a MovieClip or Sprite instance).\n\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\n...\n\nprivate var offsetX:Float;\nprivate var offsetY:Float;\n\n...\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is pressed.\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Record the difference (offset) between where\n    // the cursor was when the mouse button was pressed and the x, y\n    // coordinate of the circle when the mouse button was pressed.\n    offsetX = event.stageX - circle.x;\n    offsetY = event.stageY - circle.y;\n\n    // tell OpenFL to start listening for the mouseMove event\n    stage.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is released.\nprivate function stopDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Tell OpenFL to stop listening for the mouseMove event.\n    stage.removeEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called every time the mouse moves,\n// as long as the mouse button is pressed down.\nprivate function dragCircle (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Move the circle to the location of the cursor, maintaining\n    // the offset between the cursor's location and the\n    // location of the dragged object.\n    circle.x = event.stageX - offsetX;\n    circle.y = event.stageY - offsetY;\n\n    // Instruct OpenFL to refresh the screen after this event.\n    event.updateAfterEvent ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging);\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\nIn addition to making a display object follow the mouse cursor, it is often desirable to move the dragged object to the front of the display, so that it appears to be floating above all the other objects. For example, suppose you have two objects, a circle and a square, that can both be moved with the mouse. If the circle happens to be below the square on the display list, and you click and drag the circle so that the cursor is over the square, the circle will appear to slide behind the square, which breaks the drag-and-drop illusion. Instead, you can make it so that when the circle is clicked, it moves to the top of the display list, and thus always appears on top of any other content.\nThe following code (adapted from the previous example) allows two display objects, a circle and a square, to be moved with the mouse. Whenever the mouse button is pressed over either one, that item is moved to the top of the Stage’s display list, so that the dragged item always appears on top. \n// This code moves display objects using the mouse-following\n// technique.\n// circle is a DisplayObject (e.g. a MovieClip or Sprite instance).\n\nimport openfl.display.DisplayObject;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n\n...\n\nprivate var offsetX:Float;\nprivate var offsetY:Float;\nprivate var draggedObject:DisplayObject;\n\n...\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is pressed.\nprivate function startDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // remember which object is being dragged\n    draggedObject = cast (event.target, DisplayObject);\n\n    // Record the difference (offset) between where\n    // the cursor was when the mouse button was pressed and the x, y\n    // coordinate of the circle when the mouse button was pressed.\n    offsetX = event.stageX - circle.x;\n    offsetY = event.stageY - circle.y;\n\n    // move the selected object to the top of the display list \n    stage.addChild (draggedObject);\n\n    // tell OpenFL to start listening for the mouseMove event\n    stage.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called when the mouse button is released.\nprivate function stopDragging (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Tell OpenFL to stop listening for the mouseMove event.\n    stage.removeEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragCircle);\n\n}\n\n// This function is called every time the mouse moves,\n// as long as the mouse button is pressed down.\nprivate function dragCircle (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Move the circle to the location of the cursor, maintaining\n    // the offset between the cursor's location and the\n    // location of the dragged object.\n    circle.x = event.stageX - offsetX;\n    circle.y = event.stageY - offsetY;\n\n    // Instruct OpenFL to refresh the screen after this event.\n    event.updateAfterEvent ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging);\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, startDragging); \nsquare.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopDragging);\n\n\nTo extend this effect further, such as for a game where tokens or cards are moved among piles, you could add the dragged object to the Stage’s display list when it’s \"picked up,\" and then add it to another display list—such as the \"pile\" where it is dropped—when the mouse button is released.\nFinally, to enhance the effect, you could apply a drop shadow filter to the display object when it is clicked (when you start dragging it) and remove the drop shadow when the object is released. For details on using the drop shadow filter and other display object filters in Haxe, see Filtering display objects.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/panning-and-scrolling-display-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/panning-and-scrolling-display-objects.html","title":"Panning and scrolling display objects","keywords":"","body":"Panning and scrolling display objects \nIf you have a display object that is too large for the area in which you want it to display it, you can use the scrollRect property to define the viewable area of the display object. In addition, by changing the scrollRect property in response to user input, you can cause the content to pan left and right or scroll up and down.\nThe scrollRect property is an instance of the Rectangle class, which is a class that combines the values needed to define a rectangular area as a single object. To initially define the viewable area of the display object, create a new Rectangle instance and assign it to the display object’s scrollRect property. Later, to scroll or pan, you read the scrollRect property into a separate Rectangle variable, and change the desired property (for instance, change the Rectangle instance’s x property to pan or y property to scroll). Then you reassign that Rectangle instance to the scrollRect property to notify the display object of the changed value.\nFor example, the following code defines the viewable area for a TextField object named bigText that is too tall to fit in the project’s boundaries. When the two buttons named up and down are clicked, they call functions that cause the contents of the TextField object to scroll up or down by modifying the y property of the scrollRect Rectangle instance.\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\n// Define the initial viewable area of the TextField instance:\n// left: 0, top: 0, width: TextField's width, height: 350 pixels.\nbigText.scrollRect = new Rectangle (0, 0, bigText.width, 350);\n\n// Cache the TextField as a bitmap to improve performance.\nbigText.cacheAsBitmap = true;\n\n...\n\n// called when the \"up\" button is clicked\nprivate function scrollUp (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Get access to the current scroll rectangle.\n    var rect = bigText.scrollRect;\n\n    // Decrease the y value of the rectangle by 20, effectively\n    // shifting the rectangle down by 20 pixels.\n    rect.y -= 20;\n\n    // Reassign the rectangle to the TextField to \"apply\" the change.\n    bigText.scrollRect = rect;\n\n}\n\n// called when the \"down\" button is clicked\nprivate function scrollDown (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Get access to the current scroll rectangle.\n    var rect = bigText.scrollRect;\n\n    // Increase the y value of the rectangle by 20, effectively\n    // shifting the rectangle up by 20 pixels.\n    rect.y += 20;\n\n    // Reassign the rectangle to the TextField to \"apply\" the change.\n    bigText.scrollRect = rect;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nup.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, scrollUp);\ndown.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, scrollDown);\n\nAs this example illustrates, when you work with the scrollRect property of a display object, it’s best to specify that OpenFL should cache the display object’s content as a bitmap, using the cacheAsBitmap property. When you do so, OpenFL doesn’t have to re-draw the entire contents of the display object each time it is scrolled, and can instead use the cached bitmap to render the necessary portion directly to the screen. For details, see Caching display objects.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/manipulating-size-and-scaling-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/manipulating-size-and-scaling-objects.html","title":"Manipulating size and scaling objects","keywords":"","body":"Manipulating size and scaling objects \nYou can measure and manipulate the size of a display object in two ways, using either the dimension properties (width and height) or the scale properties (scaleX and scaleY).\nEvery display object has a width property and a height property, which are initially set to the size of the object in pixels. You can read the values of those properties to measure the size of the display object. You can also specify new values to change the size of the object, as follows:\n// Resize a display object.\nsquare.width = 420;\nsquare.height = 420;\n\n// Determine the radius of a circle display object.\nvar radius = circle.width / 2;\n\nChanging the height or width of a display object causes the object to scale, meaning its contents stretch or squeeze to fit in the new area. If the display object contains only vector shapes, those shapes will be redrawn at the new scale, with no loss in quality. Any bitmap graphic elements in the display object will be scaled rather than redrawn. So, for example, a digital photo whose width and height are increased beyond the actual dimensions of the pixel information in the image will be pixelated, making it look jagged.\nWhen you change the width or height properties of a display object, OpenFL updates the scaleX and scaleY properties of the object as well.\nNote: TextField objects are an exception to this scaling behavior. Text fields need to resize themselves to accommodate text wrapping and font sizes, so they reset their scaleX or scaleY values to 1 after resizing. However, if you adjust the scaleX or scaleY values of a TextField object, the width and height values change to accommodate the scaling values you provide.\nThese properties represent the relative size of the display object compared to its original size. The scaleX and scaleY properties use fraction (decimal) values to represent percentage. For example, if a display object’s width has been changed so that it’s half as wide as its original size, the object’s scaleX property will have the value .5, meaning 50 percent. If its height has been doubled, its scaleY property will have the value 2, meaning 200 percent.\n// circle is a display object whose width and height are 150 pixels.\n// At original size, scaleX and scaleY are 1 (100%).\ntrace (circle.scaleX); // output: 1\ntrace (circle.scaleY); // output: 1\n\n// When you change the width and height properties,\n// OpenFL changes the scaleX and scaleY properties accordingly.\ncircle.width = 100;\ncircle.height = 75;\n\ntrace (circle.scaleX); // output: 0.6622516556291391\ntrace (circle.scaleY); // output: 0.4966887417218543\n\nSize changes are not proportional. In other words, if you change the height of a square but not its width, its proportions will no longer be the same, and it will be a rectangle instead of a square. If you want to make relative changes to the size of a display object, you can set the values of the scaleX and scaleY properties to resize the object, as an alternative to setting the width or height properties. For example, this code changes the width of the display object named square, and then alters the vertical scale (scaleY) to match the horizontal scale, so that the size of the square stays proportional.\n// Change the width directly.\nsquare.width = 150;\n\n// Change the vertical scale to match the horizontal scale,\n// to keep the size proportional.\nsquare.scaleY = square.scaleX;\n\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/caching-display-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/caching-display-objects.html","title":"Caching display objects","keywords":"","body":"Caching display objects \nAs your designs in OpenFL grow in size, whether you are creating an application or complex scripted animations, you need to consider performance and optimization. When you have content that remains static (such as a rectangle Shape instance), OpenFL does not optimize the content. Therefore, when you change the position of the rectangle, OpenFL redraws the entire Shape instance.\nYou can cache specified display objects to improve the performance of your project. The display object is a surface, essentially a bitmap version of the instance’s vector data, which is data that you do not intend to change much over the course of your project. Therefore, instances with caching turned on are not continually redrawn as the project plays, letting the project render quickly.\nNote: You can update the vector data, at which time the surface is recreated. Therefore, the vector data cached in the surface does not need to remain the same for the entire project.\nSetting a display object’s cacheAsBitmap property to true makes the display object cache a bitmap representation of itself. OpenFL creates a surface object for the instance, which is a cached bitmap instead of vector data. If you change the bounds of the display object, the surface is recreated instead of resized. Surfaces can nest within other surfaces. The child surface copies its bitmap onto its parent surface. For more information, see Enabling bitmap caching.\nThe DisplayObject class’s opaqueBackground property and scrollRect property are related to bitmap caching using the cacheAsBitmap property. Although these three properties are independent of each other, the opaqueBackground and scrollRect properties work best when an object is cached as a bitmap—you see performance benefits for the opaqueBackground and scrollRect properties only when you set cacheAsBitmap to true. For more information about scrolling display object content, see Panning and scrolling display objects. For more information about setting an opaque background, see Setting an opaque background color.\nFor information on alpha channel masking, which requires you to set the cacheAsBitmap property to true, see Masking display objects.\nWhen to enable caching \nEnabling caching for a display object creates a surface, which has several advantages, such as helping complex vector animations to render fast. There are several scenarios in which you will want to enable caching. It might seem as though you would always want to enable caching to improve the performance of your projects; however, there are situations in which enabling caching does not improve performance, or can even decrease it. This section describes scenarios in which caching should be used, and when to use regular display objects.\nOverall performance of cached data depends on how complex the vector data of your instances are, how much of the data you change, and whether or not you set the opaqueBackground property. If you are changing small regions, the difference between using a surface and using vector data could be negligible. You might want to test both scenarios with your work before you deploy the application.\nWhen to use bitmap caching\nThe following are typical scenarios in which you might see significant benefits when you enable bitmap caching.\n\nComplex background image: An application that contains a detailed and complex background image of vector data (perhaps an image where you applied the trace bitmap command, or artwork that you created in Adobe Illustrator®). You might animate characters over the background, which slows the animation because the background needs to continuously regenerate the vector data. To improve performance, you can set the opaqueBackground property of the background display object to true. The background is rendered as a bitmap and can be redrawn quickly, so that your animation plays much faster.\nScrolling text field: An application that displays a large amount of text in a scrolling text field. You can place the text field in a display object that you set as scrollable with scrolling bounds (the scrollRect property). This enables fast pixel scrolling for the specified instance. When a user scrolls the display object instance, OpenFL shifts the scrolled pixels up and generates the newly exposed region instead of regenerating the entire text field.\nWindowing system: An application with a complex system of overlapping windows. Each window can be open or closed (for example, web browser windows). If you mark each window as a surface (by setting the cacheAsBitmap property to true), each window is isolated and cached. Users can drag the windows so that they overlap each other, and each window doesn’t need to regenerate the vector content.\nAlpha channel masking: When you are using alpha channel masking, you must set the cacheAsBitmap property to true. For more information, see Masking display objects.\n\nEnabling bitmap caching in all of these scenarios improves the responsiveness and interactivity of the application by optimizing the vector graphics.\nIn addition, whenever you apply a filter to a display object, cacheAsBitmap is automatically set to true, even if you explicitly set it to false. If you clear all the filters from the display object, the cacheAsBitmap property returns to the value it was last set to.\nWhen to avoid using bitmap caching\nUsing this feature in the wrong circumstances can negatively affect the performance of your project. When you use bitmap caching, remember the following guidelines:\n\nDo not overuse surfaces (display objects with caching enabled). Each surface uses more memory than a regular display object, which means that you should only enable surfaces when you need to improve rendering performance.\n\nA cached bitmap can use significantly more memory than a regular display object. For example, if a Sprite instance on the Stage is 250 pixels by 250 pixels in size, when cached it might use 250 KB instead of 1 KB when it’s a regular (un-cached) Sprite instance.\n\nAvoid zooming into cached surfaces. If you overuse bitmap caching, a large amount of memory is consumed (see previous bullet), especially if you zoom in on the content.\nUse surfaces for display object instances that are largely static (non-animating). You can drag or move the instance, but the contents of the instance should not animate or change a lot. (Animation or changing content are more likely with a MovieClip instance containing animation or a Video instance.) For example, if you rotate or transform an instance, the instance changes between the surface and vector data, which is difficult to process and negatively affects your project.\nIf you mix surfaces with vector data, it increases the amount of processing that OpenFL (and sometimes the computer) need to do. Group surfaces together as much as possible—for example, when you create windowing applications.\nDo not cache objects whose graphics change frequently. Every time you scale, skew, rotate the display object, change the alpha or color transform, move child display objects, or draw using the graphics property, the bitmap cache is redrawn. If this happens every frame, the runtime must draw the object into a bitmap and then copy that bitmap onto the stage—which results in extra work compared to just drawing the uncached object to the stage. The performance tradeoff of caching versus update frequency depends on the complexity and size of the display object and can only be determined by testing the specific content.\n\nEnabling bitmap caching \nTo enable bitmap caching for a display object, you set its cacheAsBitmap property to true: mySprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nAfter you set the cacheAsBitmap property to true, you might notice that the display object automatically pixel-snaps to whole coordinates. When you test the project, you should notice that any animation performed on a complex vector image renders much faster.\nA surface (cached bitmap) is not created, even if cacheAsBitmap is set to true, if one or more of the following occurs:\n\nThe bitmap is greater than 2880 pixels in height or width.\nThe bitmap fails to allocate (because of an out-of-memory error).\n\n\nSetting an opaque background color \nYou can set an opaque background for a display object. For example, when your project has a background that contains complex vector art, you can set the opaqueBackground property to a specified color (typically the same color as the Stage). The color is specified as a number (commonly a hexadecimal color value). The background is then treated as a bitmap, which helps optimize performance.\nWhen you set cacheAsBitmap to true, and also set the opaqueBackground property to a specified color, the opaqueBackground property allows the internal bitmap to be opaque and rendered faster. If you do not set cacheAsBitmap to true, the opaqueBackground property adds an opaque vector-square shape to the background of the display object. It does not create a bitmap automatically.\nThe following example shows how to set the background of a display object to optimize performance:\nmyShape.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nmyShape.opaqueBackground = 0xFF0000;\n\nIn this case, the background color of the Shape named myShape is set to red (0xFF0000). Assuming the Shape instance contains a drawing of a green triangle, on a Stage with a white background, this would show up as a green triangle with red in the empty space in the Shape instance’s bounding box (the rectangle that completely encloses the Shape).\n\nOf course, this code would make more sense if it were used with a Stage with a solid red background. On another colored background, that color would be specified instead. For example, in a project with a white background, the opaqueBackground property would most likely be set to 0xFFFFFF, or pure white.\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/applying-blending-modes.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/applying-blending-modes.html","title":"Applying blending modes","keywords":"","body":"Applying blending modes \nBlending modes involve combining the colors of one image (the base image) with the colors of another image (the blend image) to produce a third image—the resulting image is the one that is actually displayed on the screen.

To update the display object after any changes, you must reassign the ColorTransform instance back to the transform.colorTransform property.\nvar colorInfo = myDisplayObject.transform.colorTransform;\n\n// Make some color transformations here.\n// Commit the change.\nmyDisplayObject.transform.colorTransform = colorInfo;\n\nSetting color values with code\nThe color property of the ColorTransform class can be used to assign a specific red, green, blue (RGB) color value to the display object. The following example uses the color property to change the color of the display object named square to blue, when the user clicks a button named blueBtn:\n// square is a display object on the Stage.\n// blueBtn, redBtn, greenBtn, and blackBtn are buttons on the Stage.\n\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.geom.ColorTransform;\n\n// Get access to the ColorTransform instance associated with square.\nvar colorInfo = square.transform.colorTransform;\n\n// This function is called when blueBtn is clicked.\nprivate function makeBlue (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Set the color of the ColorTransform object.\n    colorInfo.color = 0x003399;\n\n    // apply the change to the display object square.\n    transform.colorTransform = colorInfo;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nblueBtn.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, makeBlue);\n\nNote that when you change a display object’s color using the color property, it completely changes the color of the entire object, regardless of whether the object previously had multiple colors. For example, if there is a display object containing a green circle with black text on top, setting the color property of that object’s associated ColorTransform instance to a shade of red will make the entire object, circle and text, turn red (so the text will no longer be distinguishable from the rest of the object).\nAltering color and brightness effects with code\nSuppose you have a display object with multiple colors (for example, a digital photo) and you don’t want to completely recolor the object; you just want to adjust the color of a display object based on the existing colors. In this scenario, the ColorTransform class includes a series of multiplier and offset properties that you can use to make this type of adjustment. The multiplier properties, named redMultiplier, greenMultiplier, blueMultiplier, and alphaMultiplier, work like colored photographic filters (or colored sunglasses), amplifying or diminishing certain colors in the display object. The offset properties (redOffset, greenOffset, blueOffset, and alphaOffset) can be used to add extra amounts of a certain color to the object, or to specify the minimum value that a particular color can have.\nThese multiplier and offset properties are identical to the advanced color settings that are available for movie clip symbols in the Flash authoring tool when you choose Advanced from the Color pop-up menu on the Property inspector.\nThe following code loads a JPEG image and applies a color transformation to it, which adjusts the red and green channels as the mouse pointer moves along the x axis and y axis. In this case, because no offset values are specified, the color value of each color channel displayed on screen will be a percentage of the original color value in the image—meaning that the most red or green displayed in any given pixel will be the original amount of red or green in that pixel.\nimport openfl.display.Loader;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\nimport openfl.geom.Transform;\nimport openfl.geom.ColorTransform;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\n...\n\n// Load an image onto the Stage.\nvar loader = new Loader ();\nvar url = new URLRequest (\"http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/images/image1.jpg\");\nloader.load (url);\nthis.addChild (loader);\n\n...\n\n// This function is called when the mouse moves over the loaded image.\nprivate function adjustColor (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    // Access the ColorTransform object for the Loader (containing the image)\n    var colorTransformer = loader.transform.colorTransform;\n\n    // Set the red and green multipliers according to the mouse position.\n    // The red value ranges from 0% (no red) when the cursor is at the left\n    // to 100% red (normal image appearance) when the cursor is at the right.\n    // The same applies to the green channel, except it's controlled by the\n    // position of the mouse in the y axis.\n    colorTransformer.redMultiplier = (loader.mouseX / loader.width) * 1;\n    colorTransformer.greenMultiplier = (loader.mouseY / loader.height) * 1;\n\n    // Apply the changes to the display object.\n    loader.transform.colorTransform = colorTransformer;\n\n}\n\n...\n\nloader.addEventListener (MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, adjustColor);\n\n"},"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/rotating-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/manipulating-display-objects/rotating-objects.html","title":"Rotating objects","keywords":"","body":"Rotating objects \nDisplay objects can be rotated using the rotation property.

For instance, the following code creates a Shape instance containing a red 100 by 100 pixel square and a Sprite instance containing a blue circle with a radius of 25 pixels. When the circle is clicked, it is set as the mask for the square, so that the only part of the square that shows is the part that is covered by the solid part of the circle. In other words, only a red circle will be visible.\n// This code assumes it's being run within a display object container\n// such as a MovieClip or Sprite instance.\n\nimport openfl.display.Shape;\n\n...\n\n// Draw a square and add it to the display list.\nvar square = new Shape ();\nsquare.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0xff0000);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\nsquare.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (square);\n\n// Draw a circle and add it to the display list.\nvar circle = new Sprite ();\ncircle.graphics.lineStyle (1, 0x000000);\ncircle.graphics.beginFill (0x0000ff);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle (25, 25, 25);\ncircle.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (circle);\n\n...\n\nprivate function maskSquare (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    square.mask = circle;\n    circle.removeEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, maskSquare);\n\n}\n\n...\n\ncircle.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, maskSquare);\n\nThe display object that is acting as a mask can be draggable, animated, resized dynamically, and can use separate shapes within a single mask. The mask display object doesn’t necessarily need to be added to the display list. However, if you want the mask object to scale when the Stage is scaled or if you want to enable user interaction with the mask (such as user-controlled dragging and resizing), the mask object must be added to the display list. The actual z-index (front-to-back order) of the display objects doesn’t matter, as long as the mask object is added to the display list. (The mask object will not appear on the screen except as a mask.) If the mask object is a MovieClip instance with multiple frames, it plays all the frames in its timeline, the same as it would if it were not serving as a mask. You can remove a mask by setting the mask property to null:\n// remove the mask from mySprite\nmySprite.mask = null;\n\nYou cannot use a mask to mask another mask. You cannot set the alpha property of a mask display object. Only fills are used in a display object that is used as a mask; strokes are ignored.\n\nAbout masking device fonts\nYou can use a display object to mask text that is set in a device font. When you use a display object to mask text set in a device font, the rectangular bounding box of the mask is used as the masking shape. That is, if you create a non-rectangular display object mask for device font text, the mask that appears in the project is the shape of the rectangular bounding box of the mask, not the shape of the mask itself.\nAlpha channel masking\nAlpha channel masking is supported if both the mask and the masked display objects use bitmap caching, as shown here:\n// maskShape is a Shape instance which includes a gradient fill.\nmySprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nmaskShape.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nmySprite.mask = maskShape;\n\nFor instance, one application of alpha channel masking is to use a filter on the mask object independently of a filter that is applied to the masked display object.\nIn the following example, an external image file is loaded onto the Stage. That image (or more accurately, the Loader instance it is loaded into) will be the display object that is masked. A gradient oval (solid black center fading to transparent at the edges) is drawn over the image; this will be the alpha mask. Both display objects have bitmap caching turned on. The oval is set as a mask for the image, and it is then made draggable.\n// This code assumes it's being run within a display object container\n// such as a MovieClip or Sprite instance.\n\nimport openfl.display.GradientType;\nimport openfl.display.Loader;\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.geom.Matrix;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\n...\n\n// Load an image and add it to the display list.\nvar loader = new Loader ();\nvar url = new URLRequest (\"http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/images/image1.jpg\");\nloader.load (url);\nthis.addChild (loader);\n\n// Create a Sprite.\nvar oval = new Sprite ();\n\n// Draw a gradient oval.\nvar colors = [0x000000, 0x000000];\nvar alphas = [1, 0];\nvar ratios = [0, 255];\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nmatrix.createGradientBox (200, 100, 0, -100, -50);\noval.graphics.beginGradientFill (GradientType.RADIAL, colors, alphas, ratios, matrix);\noval.graphics.drawEllipse (-100, -50, 200, 100);\noval.graphics.endFill ();\n\n// add the Sprite to the display list\nthis.addChild (oval);\n\n// Set cacheAsBitmap = true for both display objects.\nloader.cacheAsBitmap = true;\noval.cacheAsBitmap = true;\n\n// Set the oval as the mask for the loader (and its child, the loaded image)\nloader.mask = oval;\n\n// Make the oval draggable.\noval.startDrag (true);\n\n"},"display-programming/animating-objects.html":{"url":"display-programming/animating-objects.html","title":"Animating objects","keywords":"","body":"Animating objects \nAnimation is the process of making something move, or alternatively, of making something change over time. Scripted animation is a fundamental part of video games, and is often used to add polish and useful interaction clues to other applications.\nThe fundamental idea behind scripted animation is that a change needs to take place, and that change needs to be divided into increments over time. It’s easy to make something repeat in Haxe, using a common looping statement. However, a loop will run through all its iterations before updating the display. To create scripted animation, you need to write Haxe that performs some action repeatedly over time and also updates the screen each time it runs.\nFor example, imagine you want to create a simple animation, such as making a ball travel across the screen. Haxe includes a simple mechanism that allows you to track the passage of time and update the screen accordingly—meaning you could write code that moves the ball a small amount each time, until it reaches its destination. After each move the screen would update, making the cross-Stage motion visible to the viewer.\nFrom a practical standpoint, it makes sense to synchronize scripted animation with the project’s frame rate (in other words, make one animation change each time a new frame displays or would display), since that defines how frequently OpenFL updates the screen. Each display object has an enterFrame event that is dispatched according to the frame rate of the project—one event per frame. Most developers who create scripted animation use the enterFrame event as a way to create actions that repeat over time. You could write code that listens to the enterFrame event, moving the animated ball a certain amount each frame, and as the screen is updated (each frame), the ball would be redrawn in its new location, creating motion.\nNote: Another way to perform an action repeatedly over time is to use the Timer class. A Timer instance triggers an event notification each time a specified amount of time has past. You could write code that performs animation by handling the Timer class’s timer event, setting the time interval to a small one (some fraction of a second). For more information about using the Timer class, see\n\"Controlling time intervals\" on page 4\n.\nIn the following example, a circle Sprite instance, named circle, is created on the Stage. When the user clicks the circle, a scripted animation sequence begins, causing circle to fade (its alpha property is decreased) until it is completely transparent:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.events.MouseEvent;\n// draw a circle and add it to the display list\nvar circle:Sprite = new Sprite();\ncircle.graphics.beginFill(0x990000);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle(50, 50, 50);\ncircle.graphics.endFill();\naddChild(circle);\n// When this animation starts, this function is called every frame.\n// The change made by this function (updated to the screen every\n// frame) is what causes the animation to occur.\nfunction fadeCircle(event:Event):void\n{\ncircle.alpha -= .05;\nif (circle.alpha \n{\ncircle.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, fadeCircle);\n}\n}\nfunction startAnimation(event:MouseEvent):void\n{\ncircle.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, fadeCircle);\n}\ncircle.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, startAnimation);\nWhen the user clicks the circle, the function fadeCircle() is subscribed as a listener of the enterFrame event, meaning it begins to be called once per frame. That function fades circle by changing its alpha property, so once per frame the circle’s alpha decreases by .05 (5 percent) and the screen is updated. Eventually, when the alpha value is 0 (circle is completely transparent), the fadeCircle() function is removed as an event listener, ending the animation.\nThe same code could be used, for example, to create animated motion instead of fading. By substituting a different property for alpha in the function that is an enterFrame event listener, that property will be animated instead. For example, changing this line\ncircle.alpha -= .05;\nto this code\ncircle.x += 5;\nwill animate the x property, causing the circle to move to the right across the Stage. The condition that ends the animation could be changed to end the animation (that is, unsubscribe the enterFrame listener) when the desired x coordinate is reached.\n"},"display-programming/loading-display-content-dynamically/":{"url":"display-programming/loading-display-content-dynamically/","title":"Loading display content dynamically","keywords":"","body":"Loading display content dynamically \nYou can load any of the following external display assets into an OpenFL application:\n\nA project authored in Haxe—This file can be a Sprite, MovieClip, or any class that extends Sprite.\nAn image file—This includes JPG, PNG, and GIF files.\nAn AVM1 project—This is a project written in Haxe 1.0 or 2.0.

If you set this property to true, the Loader checks the origin server for a policy file (see Website controls (policy files)). This is necessary only for content originating from domains other than that of the project containing the Loader object. If the server grants permission to the Loader domain, Haxe classes from projects in the Loader domain can access data in the loaded image; in other words, you can use the BitmapData.draw() command to access data in the loaded image.\n\nNote that a project from other domains than that of the Loader object can call Security.allowDomain() to permit a specific domain.\n\nsecurityDomain: Use this property only when loading a project (not an image). Specify this for a project from a domain other than that of the file containing the Loader object.

These classes don’t necessarily provide functionality by themselves; however, they are used to define the properties of objects that are used in other classes.\nAll the geometry classes are based around the notion that locations on the screen are represented as a two-dimensional plane. The screen is treated like a flat graph with a horizontal (x) axis and a vertical (y) axis. Any location (or point) on the screen can be represented as a pair of x and y values—the coordinates of that location.\nEvery display object, including the Stage, has its own coordinate space. The coordinate space is an object’s own graph for plotting the locations of child display objects, drawings, and so on. The origin is at coordinate location 0, 0 (where the x and y-axes meet), and is placed at the upper-left corner of the display object. While this origin location is always true for the Stage, it is not necessarily true for other display objects. Values on the x-axis get bigger going toward the right, and smaller going toward the left. For locations to the left of the origin, the x coordinate is negative. However, contrary to traditional coordinate systems, OpenFL coordinate values on the y-axis get bigger going down the screen and smaller going up the screen. Values above the origin have a negative y coordinate value). Since the upper-left corner of the Stage is the origin of its coordinate space, most objects on the Stage have an x coordinate greater than 0 and smaller than the Stage width. And the same object has a y coordinate larger than 0 and smaller than the Stage height.\nYou can use Point class instances to represent individual points in a coordinate space. You can create a Rectangle instance to represent a rectangular region in a coordinate space. For advanced users, you can use a Matrix instance to apply multiple or complex transformations to a display object. Many simple transformations, such as rotation, position, and scale changes, can be applied directly to a display object using that object’s properties. For more information on applying transformations using display object properties, see Manipulating display objects.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important geometry terms:\nCartesian coordinates Coordinates are commonly written as a pair of number (like 5, 12 or 17, -23).

You can define these properties for a new Rectangle object by calling the Rectangle() constructor function, as follows:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar rx = 0;\nvar ry = 0;\nvar rwidth = 100;\nvar rheight = 50;\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (rx, ry, rwidth, rheight);\n\nResizing and repositioning Rectangle objects\nThere are a number of ways to resize and reposition Rectangle objects.\nYou can directly reposition the Rectangle object by changing its x and y properties. This change has no effect on the width or height of the Rectangle object.\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.x = 20;\nrect1.y = 30;\ntrace (rect1); // (x=20, y=30, w=100, h=50)\n\nAs the following code shows, when you change the left or top property of a Rectangle object, the rectangle is repositioned. The rectangle’s x and y properties match the left and top properties, respectively. However, the position of the lower-left corner of the Rectangle object does not change, so it is resized.\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.left = 20;\nrect1.top = 30;\ntrace (rect1); // (x=20, y=30, w=80, h=20)\n\nSimilarly, as the following example shows, if you change the bottom or right property of a Rectangle object, the position of its upper-left corner does not change. The rectangle is resized accordingly:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.right = 60;\nrect1.bottom = 20;\ntrace (rect1); // (x=0, y=0, w=60, h=20)\n\nYou can also reposition a Rectangle object by using the offset() method, as follows:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.offset (20, 30);\ntrace(rect1); // (x=20, y=30, w=100, h=50)\n\nThe offsetPt() method works similarly, except that it takes a Point object as its parameter, rather than x and y offset values.\nYou can also resize a Rectangle object by using the inflate() method, which includes two parameters, dx and dy. The dx parameter represents the number of pixels that the left and right sides of the rectangle moves from the center. The dy parameter represents the number of pixels that the top and bottom of the rectangle moves from the center:\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar x1 = 0;\nvar y1 = 0;\nvar width1 = 100;\nvar height1 = 50;\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (x1, y1, width1, height1);\ntrace (rect1) // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50)\n\nrect1.inflate (6, 4);\ntrace (rect1); // (x=-6, y=-4, w=112, h=58)\n\nThe inflatePt() method works similarly, except that it takes a Point object as its parameter, rather than dx and dy values.\nFinding unions and intersections of Rectangle objects \nYou use the union() method to find the rectangular region formed by the boundaries of two rectangles:\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect1); // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=100)\n\nvar rect2 = new Rectangle (120, 60, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect2); // (x=120, y=60, w=100, h=100)\ntrace (rect1.union (rect2)); // (x=0, y=0, w=220, h=160)\n\nYou use the intersection() method to find the rectangular region formed by the overlapping region of two rectangles:\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar rect1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect1); // (x=0, y=0, w=100, h=100)\n\nvar rect2 = new Rectangle (80, 60, 100, 100);\ntrace (rect2); // (x=120, y=60, w=100, h=100)\ntrace (rect1.intersection (rect2)); // (x=80, y=60, w=20, h=40)\n\nYou use the intersects() method to find out whether two rectangles intersect. You can also use the intersects() method to find out whether a display object is in a certain region of the Stage. For the following code example, assume the coordinate space of the display object container that contains the circle object is the same as that of the Stage. The example shows how to use the intersects() method to determine if a display object, circle, intersects specified regions of the Stage, defined by the target1 and target2 Rectangle objects:\nimport openfl.display.*;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar circle = new Shape ();\ncircle.graphics.lineStyle (2, 0xFF0000);\ncircle.graphics.drawCircle (250, 250, 100);\naddChild (circle);\n\nvar circleBounds = circle.getBounds (stage);\nvar target1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\ntrace (circleBounds.intersects (target1)); // false\n\nvar target2 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 300, 300);\ntrace (circleBounds.intersects (target2)); // true\n\nSimilarly, you can use the intersects() method to find out whether the bounding rectangles of two display objects overlap. Use the getRect() method of the DisplayObject class to include any additional space that the strokes of a display object add to a bounding region.\nOther uses of Rectangle objects \nRectangle objects are used in the following methods and properties:\n\n\n\nClass\nMethods or properties\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBitmapData\napplyFilter()colorTransform()copyChannel()copyPixels()draw()drawWithQuality()encode()fillRect()generateFilterRect()getColorBoundsRect()getPixels()merge()paletteMap()pixelDissolve()setPixels()threshold()\nUsed as the type for some parameters to define a region of the BitmapData object.\n\n\nDisplayObject\ngetBounds()getRect()scrollRectscale9Grid\nUsed as the data type for the property or the data type returned.\n\n\nPrintJob\naddPage()\nUsed to define the printArea parameter.\n\n\nSprite\nstartDrag()\nUsed to define the bounds parameter.\n\n\nTextField\ngetCharBoundaries()\nUsed as the return value type.\n\n\nTransform\npixelBounds\nUsed as the data type.\n\n\n\n"},"working-with-geometry/using-matrix-objects.html":{"url":"working-with-geometry/using-matrix-objects.html","title":"Using Matrix objects","keywords":"","body":"Using Matrix objects \nThe Matrix class represents a transformation matrix that determines how to map points from one coordinate space to another. You can perform various graphical transformations on a display object by setting the properties of a Matrix object, applying that Matrix object to the matrix property of a Transform object, and then applying that Transform object as the transform property of the display object. These transformation functions include translation (x and y repositioning), rotation, scaling, and skewing.\nAlthough you could define a matrix by directly adjusting the properties (a, b, c, d, tx, ty) of a Matrix object, it is easier to use the createBox() method. This method includes parameters that let you directly define the scaling, rotation, and translation effects of the resulting matrix. For example, the following code creates a Matrix object that scales an object horizontally by 2.0, scales it vertically by 3.0, rotates it by 45°, moving (translating) it 10 pixels to the right, and moving it 20 pixels down:\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nvar scaleX = 2.0;\nvar scaleY = 3.0;\nvar rotation = 2 * Math.PI * (45 / 360);\nvar tx = 10;\nvar ty = 20;\nmatrix.createBox (scaleX, scaleY, rotation, tx, ty);\n\nYou can also adjust the scaling, rotation, and translation effects of a Matrix object by using the scale(), rotate(), and translate() methods. Note that these methods combine with the values of the existing Matrix object. For example, the following code sets a Matrix object that scales an object by a factor of 4 and rotates it 60°, since the scale() and rotate() methods are called twice:\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nvar rotation = 2 * Math.PI * (30 / 360); // 30°\nvar scaleFactor = 2;\nmatrix.scale (scaleFactor, scaleFactor);\nmatrix.rotate (rotation);\nmatrix.scale (scaleX, scaleY);\nmatrix.rotate (rotation);\n\nmyDisplayObject.transform.matrix = matrix;\n\nTo apply a skew transformation to a Matrix object, adjust its b or c property. Adjusting the b property skews the matrix vertically, and adjusting the c property skews the matrix horizontally. The following code skews the myMatrix Matrix object vertically by a factor of 2:\nvar skewMatrix = new Matrix ();\nskewMatrix.b = Math.tan (2);\nmyMatrix.concat (skewMatrix);\n\nYou can apply a Matrix transformation to the transform property of a display object. For example, the following code applies a matrix transformation to a display object named myDisplayObject:\nvar matrix = myDisplayObject.transform.matrix;\nvar scaleFactor = 2;\nvar rotation = 2 * Math.PI * (60 / 360); // 60°\nmatrix.scale (scaleFactor, scaleFactor);\nmatrix.rotate (rotation);\n\nmyDisplayObject.transform.matrix = matrix;\n\nThe first line sets a Matrix object to the existing transformation matrix used by the myDisplayObject display object (the matrix property of the transformation property of the myDisplayObject display object). This way, the Matrix class methods that you call have a cumulative effect on the display object’s existing position, scale, and rotation.\nNote: The ColorTransform class is also included in the openfl.geom package. This class is used to set the colorTransform property of a Transform object. Since it does not apply any geometrical transformation, it is not discussed, in detail, here.

The openfl.display.Graphics class provides this functionality. You can draw with Haxe code on any Shape, Sprite, or MovieClip instance, using the graphics property defined in each of those classes. (Each of those classes’ graphics property is in fact an instance of the Graphics class.)\nIf you’re just getting started with drawing with code, the Graphics class includes several methods that make it easy to draw common shapes like circles, ellipses, rectangles, and rectangles with rounded corners. You can draw them as empty lines or filled shapes. When you need more advanced functionality, the Graphics class also includes methods for drawing lines and quadratic Bézier curves, which you can use in conjunction with the trigonometry functions in the Math class to create any shape you need.\nOpenFL adds an additional API for drawing, which allow you to programmatically draw entire shapes with a single command. Once you’re familiar with the Graphics class and tasks covered in Basics of using the drawing API, continue to Advanced use of the drawing API to learn more about these drawing API features.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter while using the drawing API:\nAnchor point One of the two end points of a quadratic Bézier curve.\nControl point The point that defines the direction and amount of curve of a quadratic Bézier curve. The curved line never reaches the control point; however, the line curves as though being drawn toward the control point.\nCoordinate space The graph of coordinates contained in a display object, on which its child elements are positioned.\nFill The solid inner portion of a shape that has a line filled in with color, or all of a shape that has no outline.\nGradient A color that consists of a gradual transition from one color to one or more other colors (as opposed to a solid color).\nPoint A single location in a coordinate space. In the 2-d coordinate system used in Haxe, a point is defined by its location along the x axis and the y axis (the point’s coordinates).\nQuadratic Bézier curve A type of curve defined by a particular mathematical formula. In this type of curve, the shape of the curve is calculated based on the positions of the anchor points (the end points of the curve) and a control point that defines the amount and direction of the curve.\nScale The size of an object relative to its original size. When used as a verb, to scale an object means to change its size by stretching or shrinking the object.\nStroke The outline portion of a shape that has a line filled in with color, or the lines of an un-filled shape.\nTranslate To change a point’s coordinates from one coordinate space to another.\nX axis The horizontal axis in the 2-d coordinate system used in Haxe.\nY axis The vertical axis in the 2-d coordinate system used in Haxe.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/understanding-the-graphics-class.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/understanding-the-graphics-class.html","title":"Understanding the Graphics class","keywords":"","body":"Understanding The Graphics class \nEach Shape, Sprite, and MovieClip object has a graphics property, which is an instance of the Graphics class.

A Shape instance will perform better than other display objects for drawing, because it doesn’t have the overhead of the additional functionality in the Sprite and MovieClip classes.

Consequently, all Haxe-based drawing must be performed using the same series of steps:\n\nDefine line and fill styles\nSet the initial drawing position\nDraw lines, curves, and shapes (optionally moving the drawing point)\nIf necessary, finish creating a fill\n\nDefining line and fill styles\nTo draw with the graphics property of a Shape, Sprite, or MovieClip instance, you must first define the style (line size and color, fill color) to use when drawing. Just like when you use the drawing tools in Adobe® Flash® Professional or another drawing application, when you’re using Haxe code to draw you can draw with or without a stroke, and with or without a fill color. You specify the appearance of the stroke using the lineStyle() or lineGradientStyle() method. To create a solid line, use the lineStyle() method. When calling this method, the most common values you’ll specify are the first three parameters: lineThickness, color, and alpha. For example, this line of code tells the Shape named myShape to draw lines that are 2 pixels thick, red (0x990000), and 75% opaque:\nmyShape.graphics.lineStyle (2, 0x990000, .75);\n\nThe default value for the alpha parameter is 1.0 (100%), so you can leave that parameter off if you want a completely opaque line. The lineStyle() method also accepts two additional parameters for pixel hinting and scale mode; for more information about using those parameters see the description of the Graphics.lineStyle() method in the API Reference.\nTo create a gradient line, use the lineGradientStyle() method. This method is described in Creating gradient lines and fills.\nIf you want to create a filled shape, you call the beginFill(), beginGradientFill(), beginBitmapFill(), or beginShaderFill() methods before starting the drawing. The most basic of these, the beginFill() method, accepts two parameters: the fill color, and (optionally) an alpha value for the fill color. For example, if you want to draw a shape with a solid green fill, you would use the following code (assuming you’re drawing on an object named myShape):\nmyShape.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00);\n\nCalling any fill method implicitly ends any previous fill before starting a new one. Calling any method that specifies a stroke style replaces the previous stroke, but does not alter a previously specified fill, and vice versa.\nOnce you have specified the line style and fill properties, the next step is to indicate the starting point for your drawing. The Graphics instance has a drawing point, like the tip of a pen on a piece of paper. Wherever the drawing point is located, that is where the next drawing action will begin. Initially a Graphics object begins with its drawing point at the point 0, 0 in the coordinate space of the object on which it’s drawing. To start the drawing at a different point, you can first call the moveTo() method before calling one of the drawing methods. This is analogous to lifting the pen tip off of the paper and moving it to a new position.\nWith the drawing point in place you draw using a series of calls to the drawing methods lineTo() (for drawing straight lines) and curveTo() (for drawing curved lines).\nWhile you are drawing, you can call the moveTo() method at any time to move the drawing point to a new position without drawing.\nWhile drawing, if you have specified a fill color, you can close off the fill by calling the endFill() method. If you have not drawn a closed shape (in other words, if at the time you call endFill() the drawing point is not at the starting point of the shape), when you call the endFill() method OpenFL automatically closes the shape by drawing a straight line from the current drawing point to the location specified in the most recent moveTo() call. If you have started a fill and not called endFill(), calling beginFill() (or one of the other fill methods) closes the current fill and starts the new one.\nDrawing straight lines \nWhen you call the lineTo() method, the Graphics object draws a straight line from the current drawing point to the coordinates you specify as the two parameters in the method call, drawing with the line style you have specified. For example, this line of code puts the drawing point at the point 100, 100 then draws a line to the point 200, 200:\nmyShape.graphics.moveTo (100, 100);\nmyShape.graphics.lineTo (200, 200);\n\nThe following example draws red and green triangles with a height of 100 pixels:\nvar triangleHeight = 100;\nvar triangle = new Shape ();\n\n// red triangle, starting at point 0, 0\ntriangle.graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\ntriangle.graphics.moveTo (triangleHeight / 2, 0);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (triangleHeight, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (0, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (triangleHeight / 2, 0);\n\n// green triangle, starting at point 200, 0\ntriangle.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00);\ntriangle.graphics.moveTo (200 + triangleHeight / 2, 0);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (200 + triangleHeight, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (200, triangleHeight);\ntriangle.graphics.lineTo (200 + triangleHeight / 2, 0);\nthis.addChild (triangle);\n\nDrawing curves \nThe curveTo() method draws a quadratic Bézier curve. This draws an arc that connects two points (called anchor points) while bending toward a third point (called the control point). The Graphics object uses the current drawing position as the first anchor point. When you call the curveTo() method, you pass four parameters: the x and y coordinates of the control point, followed by the x and y coordinates of the second anchor point. For example, the following code draws a curve starting at point 100, 100 and ending at point 200, 200. Because the control point is at point 175, 125, this creates a curve that moves to the right and then downward:\nmyShape.graphics.moveTo (100, 100);\nmyShape.graphics.curveTo (175, 125, 200, 200);\n\nThe following example draws red and green circular objects with a width and height of 100 pixels. Note that due to the nature of the quadratic Bézier equation, these are not perfect circles:\nvar size = 100;\nvar roundObject = new Shape ();\n\n// red circular shape\nroundObject.graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000);\nroundObject.graphics.moveTo (size / 2, 0);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (size, 0, size, size / 2);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (size, size, size / 2, size);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (0, size, 0, size / 2);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (0, 0, size / 2, 0);\n\n// green circular shape\nroundObject.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00);\nroundObject.graphics.moveTo (200 + size / 2, 0);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (200 + size, 0, 200 + size, size / 2); roundObject.graphics.curveTo (200 + size, size, 200 + size / 2, size); roundObject.graphics.curveTo (200, size, 200, size / 2);\nroundObject.graphics.curveTo (200, 0, 200 + size / 2, 0); \nthis.addChild (roundObject);\n\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/drawing-shapes-using-built-in-methods.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/drawing-shapes-using-built-in-methods.html","title":"Drawing shapes using built-in methods","keywords":"","body":"Drawing shapes using built-in methods \nFor convenience when drawing common shapes such as circles, ellipses, rectangles, and rectangles with rounded corners, OpenFL has methods that draw these common shapes for you. These are the drawCircle(), drawEllipse(), drawRect(), and drawRoundRect() methods of the Graphics class. These methods may be used in place of the lineTo() and curveTo() methods. Note, however, that you must still specify line and fill styles before calling these methods.\nThe following example recreates the example of drawing red, green, and blue squares with width and height of 100 pixels. This code uses the drawRect() method, and additionally specifies that the fill color has an alpha of 50% (0.5):\nvar squareSize = 100;\nvar square = new Shape ();\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0xFF0000, 0.5);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, squareSize, squareSize);\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0x00FF00, 0.5);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (200, 0, squareSize, squareSize);\nsquare.graphics.beginFill (0x0000FF, 0.5);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (400, 0, squareSize, squareSize);\nsquare.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (square);\n\nIn a Sprite or MovieClip object, the drawing content created with the graphics property always appears behind all child display objects that are contained by the object.

When you define a gradient, you supply a matrix as one of the parameters of these methods.\nThe easiest way to define the matrix is by using the Matrix class’s createGradientBox() method, which creates a matrix that is used to define the gradient. You define the scale, rotation, and position of the gradient using the parameters passed to the createGradientBox() method. The createGradientBox() method accepts the following parameters:\n\nGradient box width: the width (in pixels) to which the gradient will spread\nGradient box height: the height (in pixels) to which the gradient will spread\nGradient box rotation: the rotation (in radians) that will be applied to the gradient\nHorizontal translation: how far (in pixels) the gradient is shifted horizontally\nVertical translation: how far (in pixels) the gradient is shifted vertically For example, consider a gradient with the following characteristics:\nGradientType.LINEAR\nTwo colors, green and blue, with the ratios array set to [0, 255]\nSpreadMethod.PAD\nInterpolationMethod.LINEAR_RGB\n\nThe following examples show gradients in which the rotation parameter of the createGradientBox() method differs as indicated, but all other settings stay the same:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 100;rotation = Math.PI/4; // 45°tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 100;rotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\n\nThe following examples show the effects on a green-to-blue linear gradient in which the rotation, tx, and ty parameters of the createGradientBox() method differ as indicated, but all other settings stay the same:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth = 50;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 50;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 50;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 50;rotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°tx = 0;ty = 0;\n\n\n\nwidth = 100;height = 50;rotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°tx = 0;ty = 50;\n\n\n\n\nThe width, height, tx, and ty parameters of the createGradientBox() method affect the size and position of a radial gradient fill as well, as the following example shows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidth = 50;height = 100;rotation = 0;tx = 25;ty = 0;\n\n\n\n\nThe following code produces the last radial gradient illustrated:\nimport openfl.display.Shape;\nimport openfl.display.GradientType;\nimport openfl.geom.Matrix;\n\n...\n\nvar type = GradientType.RADIAL;\nvar colors = [0x00FF00, 0x000088];\nvar alphas = [1, 1];\nvar ratios = [0, 255];\nvar spreadMethod = SpreadMethod.PAD;\nvar interp = InterpolationMethod.LINEAR_RGB;\nvar focalPtRatio = 0;\n\nvar matrix = new Matrix ();\nvar boxWidth = 50;\nvar boxHeight = 100;\nvar boxRotation = Math.PI/2; // 90°\nvar tx = 25;\nvar ty = 0;\nmatrix.createGradientBox (boxWidth, boxHeight, boxRotation, tx, ty);\n\nvar square = new Shape ();\nsquare.graphics.beginGradientFill (type, colors, alphas, ratios, matrix, spreadMethod, interp, focalPtRatio);\nsquare.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 100, 100);\naddChild (square);\n\nNote that the width and height of the gradient fill is determined by the width and height of the gradient matrix rather than the width or height that is drawn using the Graphics object. When drawing with the Graphics object, you draw what exists at those coordinates in the gradient matrix. Even if you use one of the shape methods of a Graphics object such as drawRect(), the gradient does not stretch itself to the size of the shape that is drawn—the gradient’s size must be specified in the gradient matrix itself.\nThe following illustrates the visual difference between the dimensions of the gradient matrix and the dimensions of the draw itself:\nvar myShape = new Shape ();\nvar gradientBoxMatrix = new Matrix ();\ngradientBoxMatrix.createGradientBox (100, 40, 0, 0, 0);\nmyShape.graphics.beginGradientFill (GradientType.LINEAR, [0xFF0000, 0x00FF00, 0x0000FF], [1, 1, 1], [0, 128, 255], gradientBoxMatrix);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 50, 40);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 50, 100, 40);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 100, 150, 40);\nmyShape.graphics.endFill ();\nthis.addChild (myShape);\n\nThis code draws three gradients with the same fill style, specified with an equal distribution of red, green, and blue. The gradients are drawn using the drawRect() method with pixel widths of 50, 100, and 150 respectively. The gradient matrix which is specified in the beginGradientFill() method is created with a width of 100 pixels. This means that the first gradient will encompass only half of the gradient spectrum, the second will encompass all of it, and the third will encompass all of it and have an additional 50 pixels of blue extending to the right.\nThe lineGradientStyle() method works similarly to beginGradientFill() except that in addition to defining the gradient, you must specify the thickness of the stroke using the lineStyle() method before drawing. The following code draws a box with a red, green, and blue gradient stroke:\nvar myShape = new Shape ();\nvar gradientBoxMatrix = new Matrix ();\ngradientBoxMatrix.createGradientBox (200, 40, 0, 0, 0);\nmyShape.graphics.lineStyle (5, 0);\nmyShape.graphics.lineGradientStyle (GradientType.LINEAR, [0xFF0000, 0x00FF00, 0x0000FF], [1, 1, 1], [0, 128, 255], gradientBoxMatrix);\nmyShape.graphics.drawRect (0, 0, 200, 40);\nthis.addChild (myShape);\n\nFor more information on the Matrix class, see Using Matrix objects.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/using-the-math-class-with-drawing-methods.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/using-the-math-class-with-drawing-methods.html","title":"Using the Math class with drawing methods","keywords":"","body":"Using the Math class with drawing methods \nA Graphics object draws circles and squares, but can also draw more complex forms, particularly when the drawing methods are used in combination with the properties and methods of the Math class.

The drawing API enhancements for these runtimes expand upon the standard drawing methods so you can establish data sets to generate shapes, alter shapes at runtime, and create three-dimensional effects. The drawing API enhancements consolidate existing methods into alternative commands. These commands leverage vector arrays and enumeration classes to provide data sets for drawing methods. Using vector arrays allows for more complex shapes to render quickly and for developers to change the array values programmatically for dynamic shape rendering at runtime.\nThese advanced drawing features are described in the following sections: Drawing Paths, Using graphics data classes and About using drawTriangles().\nThe following tasks are things you’ll likely want to accomplish using the advanced drawing API in OpenFL:\n\nUsing Vector objects to store data for drawing methods\nDefining paths for drawing shapes programmatically in a single operation\nDefining winding rules to determine how overlapping shapes are filled\nReading the vector graphics content of a display object, such as to serialize and save the graphics data, to generate a spritesheet at runtime, or to draw a copy of the vector graphics content\nUsing triangles and drawing methods for three-dimensional effects\n\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you will encounter in this section:\n\nVector: An array of values all of the same data type.

The beginning and end of each segment are marked by coordinates, which work like pins holding a wire in place. A path can be closed (for example, a circle), or open, with distinct endpoints (for example, a wavy line).\nWinding: The direction of a path as interpreted by the renderer; either positive (clockwise) or negative (counter- clockwise).\nGraphicsStroke: A class for setting the line style. While the term \"stroke\" isn’t part of the drawing API enhancements, the use of a class to designate a line style with its own fill property is part of the new drawing API. You can dynamically adjust a line’s style using the GraphicsStroke class.\nFill object: Objects created using display classes like openfl.display.GraphicsBitmapFill and openfl.display.GraphicsGradientFill that are passed to the drawing command Graphics.drawGraphicsData().

The Graphics.drawPath() and Graphics.drawTriangles() methods accept a set of objects representing those same drawing commands as a parameter. With these methods, you can provide a series of Graphics.lineTo(), Graphics.curveTo(), or Graphics.moveTo() commands for the compiled project to execute in a single statement.\nThe GraphicsPathCommand enumeration class defines a set of constants that correspond to drawing commands. You pass a series of these constants (wrapped in a Vector instance) as a parameter for the Graphics.drawPath() method. Then with a single command you can render an entire shape, or several shapes. You can also alter the values passed to these methods to change an existing shape.\nIn addition to the Vector of drawing commands, the drawPath() method needs a set of coordinates that correspond to the coordinates for each drawing command. Create a Vector instance containing coordinates (Float values) and pass it to the drawPath() method as the second (data) argument.\nNote: The values in the vector are not Point objects; the vector is a series of numbers where each group of two numbers represents an x/y coordinate pair.\nThe Graphics.drawPath() method matches each command with its respective point values (a collection of two or four numbers) to generate a path in the Graphics object:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.*;\n\nclass DrawPathExample extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var squareCommands = new Vector (5, true);\n        squareCommands[0] = GraphicsPathCommand.MOVE_TO;\n        squareCommands[1] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;\n        squareCommands[2] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;\n        squareCommands[3] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;\n        squareCommands[4] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;\n\n        var squareCoord = new Vector (10, true);\n        squareCoord[0] = 20; //x\n        squareCoord[1] = 10; //y squareCoord[2] = 50;\n        squareCoord[3] = 10;\n        squareCoord[4] = 50;\n        squareCoord[5] = 40;\n        squareCoord[6] = 20;\n        squareCoord[7] = 40;\n        squareCoord[8] = 20;\n        squareCoord[9] = 10;\n        graphics.beginFill (0x442266); //set the color\n        graphics.drawPath (squareCommands, squareCoord);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/advanced-use-of-the-drawing-api/defining-winding-rules.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/advanced-use-of-the-drawing-api/defining-winding-rules.html","title":"Defining winding rules","keywords":"","body":"Defining winding rules \nThe enhanced drawing API also introduces the concept of path \"winding\": the direction for a path. The winding for a path is either positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise). The order in which the renderer interprets the coordinates provided by the vector for the data parameter determines the winding.\n\nPositive and negative winding\nA. Arrows indicate drawing direction B. Positively wound (clockwise) C. Negatively wound (counter-clockwise)\nAdditionally, notice that the Graphics.drawPath() method has an optional third parameter called \"winding\":\ndrawPath (commands:Vector, data:Vector, winding:String = GraphicsPathWinding.EVEN_ODD):Void\n\nIn this context, the third parameter is a string or a constant that specifies the winding or fill rule for intersecting paths. (The constant values are defined in the GraphicsPathWinding class as GraphicsPathWinding.EVEN_ODD or GraphicsPathWinding.NON_ZERO.) The winding rule is important when paths intersect.\nThe even-odd rule is the standard winding rule and is the rule used by the legacy drawing API. The even-odd rule is also the default rule for the Graphics.drawPath() method. With the even-odd winding rule, any intersecting paths alternate between open and closed fills. If two squares drawn with the same fill intersect, the area in which the intersection occurs is filled. Generally, adjacent areas are neither both filled nor both unfilled.\nThe non-zero rule, on the other hand, depends on winding (drawing direction) to determine whether areas defined by intersecting paths are filled. When paths of opposite winding intersect, the area defined is unfilled, much like with even-odd. For paths of the same winding, the area that would be unfilled is filled:\n\nWinding rules for intersecting areas\nA. Even-odd winding rule B. Non-zero winding rule\nWinding rule names\nThe names refer to a more specific rule that defines how these fills are managed. Positively wound paths are assigned a value of +1; negatively wound paths are assigned a value of -1. Starting from a point within an enclosed area of a shape, draw a line from that point extending out indefinitely. The number of times that line crosses a path, and the combined values of those paths, are used to determine the fill. For even-odd winding, the count of times the line crosses a path is used. When the count is odd, the area is filled. For even counts, the area is unfilled. For non-zero winding, the values assigned to the paths are used. When the combined values of the path are not 0, the area is filled. When the combined value is 0, the area is unfilled.\n\nWinding rule counts and fills\nA. Even-odd winding rule B. Non-zero winding rule\nUsing winding rules\nThese fill rules are complicated, but in some situations they are necessary. For example, consider drawing a star shape. With the standard even-odd rule, the shape would require ten different lines. With the non-zero winding rule, those ten lines are reduced to five. Here is the Haxe code for a star with five lines and a non-zero winding rule:\ngraphics.beginFill (0x60A0FF);\ngraphics.drawPath (Vector.ofArray ([1,2,2,2,2]), Vector.ofArray ([66, 10, 23, 127, 122, 50, 10, 49, 109, 127.0 ]), GraphicsPathWinding.NON_ZERO);\n\nAnd here is the star shape:\n\nA star shape using different winding rules\nA. Even-odd 10 lines B. Even-odd 5 lines C. Non-zero 5 lines\nAnd, as images are animated or used as textures on three-dimensional objects and overlap, the winding rules become more important.\n"},"using-the-drawing-api/advanced-use-of-the-drawing-api/using-graphics-data-classes.html":{"url":"using-the-drawing-api/advanced-use-of-the-drawing-api/using-graphics-data-classes.html","title":"Using graphics data classes","keywords":"","body":"Using graphics data classes \nThe enhanced drawing API includes a set of classes in the openfl.display package that implement the IGraphicsData interface.

You can then reuse the graphics data as the data source for other shape instances or to store drawing information for later use.\nNotice you have multiple fill classes for each style of fill, but only one stroke class. OpenFL has only one stroke IGraphicsData class because the stroke class uses the fill classes to define its style. So every stroke is actually defined by a combination of the stroke class and a fill class.

These utility methods simplify the task of defining or updating the commands and data values directly.\nDrawing with vector graphics data\nOnce you have a collection of IGraphicsData instances, use the Graphics class’s drawGraphicsData() method to render the graphics. The drawGraphicsData() method carries out a set of drawing instructions from a vector of IGraphicsData instances in sequential order:\n// stroke object\nvar stroke = new GraphicsStroke (3);\nstroke.joints = JointStyle.MITER;\nstroke.fill = new GraphicsSolidFill (0x102020); // solid stroke\n\n// fill object\nvar fill = new GraphicsGradientFill ();\nfill.colors = [0x0000FF, 0xEEFFEE];\nfill.matrix = new Matrix ();\nfill.matrix.createGradientBox (70, 70, Math.PI/2);\n\n// path object\nvar path = new GraphicsPath (new Vector (), new Vector ());\npath.commands.push (GraphicsPathCommand.MOVE_TO, GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO, GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO);\npath.data.push (125, 0, 50, 100, 175, 0);\n\n// combine objects for complete drawing\nvar drawing = new Vector ();\ndrawing.push (stroke, fill, path);\n\n// draw the drawing graphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\n\nBy modifying one value in the path used by the drawing in the example, the shape can be redrawn multiple times for a more complex image:\n// draw the drawing multiple times\n// change one value to modify each variation\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] += 200;\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] -= 150;\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] += 100;\ngraphics.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\npath.data[2] -= 50;\ngraphicsS.drawGraphicsData (drawing);\n\nThough IGraphicsData objects can define fill and stroke styles, the fill and stroke styles are not a requirement. In other words, Graphics class methods can be used to set styles while IGraphicsData objects can be used to draw a saved collection of paths, or vice-versa.\nNote: Use the Graphics.clear() method to clear out a previous drawing before starting a new one; unless you're adding on to the original drawing, as seen in the example above. As you change a single portion of a path or collection of IGraphicsData objects, redraw the entire drawing to see the changes.\nWhen using graphics data classes, the fill is rendered whenever three or more points are drawn, because the shape is inherently closed at that point. Even though the fill closes, the stroke does not, and this behavior is different than when using multiple Graphics.lineTo() or Graphics.moveTo() commands.\nReading vector graphics data\nIn addition to drawing vector content to a display object, you can use the Graphics class’s readGraphicsData() method to obtain a data representation of the vector graphics content of a display object. This can be used to create a snapshot of a graphic to save, copy, create a spritesheet at run time, and more.\nCalling the readGraphicsData() method returns a Vector instance containing IGraphicsData objects. These are the same objects used to draw vector graphics with the drawGraphicsData() method.\nThere are several limitations to reading vector graphics with the readGraphicsData() method.

These are recommended over drawTriangles() for 3D\n\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/","title":"Chapter 5: Working with bitmaps","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5: Working with bitmaps \nIn addition to its vector drawing capabilities, OpenFL includes the ability to create bitmap images or manipulate the pixel data of external bitmap images that are loaded into a SWF. With the ability to access and change individual pixel values, you can create your own filter-like image effects and use the built-in noise functions to create textures and random noise.\n\nBasics of working with bitmaps\nWhen you work with digital images, you’re likely to encounter two main types of graphics: bitmap and vector. Bitmap graphics, also known as raster graphics, are composed of tiny squares (pixels) that are arranged in a rectangular grid formation. Vector graphics are composed of mathematically generated geometric shapes such as lines, curves, and polygons.\nBitmap images are defined by the width and height of the image, measured in pixels, and the number of bits contained in each pixel, which represents the number of colors a pixel can contain. In the case of a bitmap image that utilizes the RGB color model, the pixels are made up of three bytes: red, green, and blue. Each of these bytes contains a value ranging from 0 to 255. When the bytes are combined within the pixel, they produce a color similar to an artist mixing paint colors. For example, a pixel containing byte values of red-255, green-102 and blue-0 would produce a vibrant orange color.\nThe quality of a bitmap image is determined by combining the resolution of the image with its color depth bit value. Resolution relates to the number of pixels contained within an image. The greater the number of pixels, the higher the resolution and the finer the image appears. Color depth relates to the amount of information a pixel can contain. For example, an image that has a color depth value of 16 bits per pixel cannot represent the same number of colors as an image that has a color depth of 48 bits. As a result, the 48-bit image will have smoother degrees of shading than its 16-bit counterpart.\nBecause bitmap graphics are resolution-dependent, they don’t scale very well. This is most noticeable when bitmap images are scaled up in size. Scaling up a bitmap usually results in a loss of detail and quality.\nBitmap file formats\nBitmap images are grouped into a number of common file formats. These formats use different types of compression algorithms to reduce file size, as well as optimize image quality based on the end purpose of the image. The bitmap image formats supported by Adobe runtimes are BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, and TIFF.\nBMP\nThe BMP (bit mapped) format is a default image format used by the Microsoft Windows operating system. It does not use any form of compression algorithm and as such usually results in large file sizes.\nGIF\nThe Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) was originally developed by CompuServe in 1987 as a means to transmit images with 256 colors (8-bit color). The format provides small file sizes and is ideal for web-based images. Because of this format’s limited color palette, GIF images are generally not suitable for photographs, which typically require high degrees of shading and color gradients. GIF images permit single-bit transparency, which allows colors to be mapped as clear (or transparent). This results in the background color of a web page showing through the image where the transparency has been mapped.\nJPEG\nDeveloped by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), the JPEG (often written JPG) image format uses a lossy compression algorithm to allow 24-bit color depth with a small file size. Lossy compression means that each time the image is saved, the image loses quality and data but results in a smaller file size. The JPEG format is ideal for photographs because it is capable of displaying millions of colors. The ability to control the degree of compression applied to an image allows you to manipulate image quality and file size.\nPNG\nThe Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was produced as an open-source alternative to the patented GIF file format. PNGs support up to 64-bit color depth, allowing for up to 16 million colors. Because PNG is a relatively new format, some older browsers don’t support PNG files. Unlike JPGs, PNGs use lossless compression, which means that none of the image data is lost when the image is saved. PNG files also support alpha transparency, which allows for up to 256 levels of transparency.\nTIFF\nThe Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) was the cross-platform format of choice before the PNG was introduced. The drawback with the TIFF format is that because of the many different varieties of TIFF, there is no single reader that can handle every version. In addition, no web browsers currently support the format. TIFF can use either lossy or lossless compression, and is able to handle device-specific color spaces (such as CMYK).\nTransparent bitmaps and opaque bitmaps\nBitmap images that use either the GIF or PNG formats can have an extra byte (alpha channel) added to each pixel. This extra pixel byte represents the transparency value of the pixel.\nGIF images allow single-bit transparency, which means that you can specify a single color, from a 256-color palette, to be transparent. PNG images, on the other hand, can have up to 256 levels of transparency. This function is especially beneficial when images or text are required to blend into backgrounds.\nOpenFL replicates this extra transparency pixel byte within the BitmapData class. Similar to the PNG transparency model, OpenFL offers up to 256 levels of transparency.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following list contains important terms that you will encounter when learning about bitmap graphics:\nAlpha The level of transparency (or more accurately, opacity) in a color or an image. The amount of alpha is often described as the alpha channel value.\nARGB color A color scheme where each pixel’s color is a mixture of red, green, and blue color values, and its transparency is specified as an alpha value.\nColor channel Commonly, colors are represented as a mixture of a few basic colors—usually (for computer graphics) red, green, and blue. Each basic color is considered a color channel; the amount of color in each color channel, mixed together, determines the final color.\nColor depth Also known as bit depth, this refers to the amount of computer memory that is devoted to each pixel, which in turn determines the number of possible colors that can be represented in the image.\nPixel The smallest unit of information in a bitmap image—essentially a dot of color.\nResolution The pixel dimensions of an image, which determines the level of fine-grained detail contained in the image. Resolution is often expressed in terms of width and height in number of pixels.\nRGB color A color scheme where each pixel’s color is represented as a mixture of red, green, and blue color values.\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/the-bitmap-and-bitmapdata-classes.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/the-bitmap-and-bitmapdata-classes.html","title":"The Bitmap and BitmapData classes","keywords":"","body":"The Bitmap and BitmapData classes \nThe main OpenFL classes for working with bitmap images are the Bitmap class, which is used to display bitmap images on the screen, and the BitmapData class, which is used to access and manipulate the raw image data of a bitmap.\nMore Help topics\n\nopenfl.display.Bitmap\nopenfl.display.BitmapData\n\nUnderstanding the Bitmap class \nAs a subclass of the DisplayObject class, the Bitmap class is the main OpenFL class used for displaying bitmap images. These images may have been loaded via the openfl.display.Loader class or created dynamically using the Bitmap() constructor. When loading an image from an external source, a Bitmap object can only use GIF, JPEG, or PNG format images. Once instantiated, the Bitmap instance can be considered a wrapper for a BitmapData object that needs to be rendered to the Stage. Because a Bitmap instance is a display object, all the characteristics and functionality of display objects can be used to manipulate a Bitmap instance as well. For more information about working with display objects, see Display programming.\nPixel snapping and smoothing \nIn addition to the functionality common to all display objects, the Bitmap class provides some additional features that are specific to bitmap images.\nThe pixelSnapping property of the Bitmap class determines whether or not a Bitmap object snaps to its nearest pixel. This property accepts one of three constants defined in the PixelSnapping class: ALWAYS, AUTO, and NEVER.\nThe syntax for applying pixel snapping is as follows:\nmyBitmap.pixelSnapping = PixelSnapping.ALWAYS;\n\nOften, when bitmap images are scaled, they become blurred and distorted. To help reduce this distortion, use the smoothing property of the BitmapData class. This Boolean property, when set to true, smooths, or anti-aliases, the pixels within the image when it is scaled. This gives the image a clearer and more natural appearance.\nUnderstanding the BitmapData class \nThe BitmapData class, which is in the openfl.display package, can be likened to a photographic snapshot of the pixels contained within a loaded or dynamically created bitmap image. This snapshot is represented by an array of pixel data within the object. The BitmapData class also contains a series of built-in methods that are useful for creation and manipulation of pixel data.\nTo instantiate a BitmapData object, use the following code:\nvar myBitmap = new BitmapData (width:Int, height:Int, transparent:Bool, fillColor:Int);\n\nThe width and height parameters specify the size of the bitmap. The maximum size of a bitmap is dependent on the operating system.\n\nThe transparent parameter specifies whether the bitmap data includes an alpha channel (true) or not (false). The fillColor parameter is a 32-bit color value that specifies the background color, as well as the transparency value (if it has been set to true). The following example creates a BitmapData object with an orange background that is 50 percent transparent:\nvar myBitmap = new BitmapData (150, 150, true, 0x80FF3300);\nTo render a newly created BitmapData object to the screen, assign it to or wrap it in a Bitmap instance. To do this, you can either pass the BitmapData object as a parameter of the Bitmap object’s constructor, or you can assign it to the bitmapData property of an existing Bitmap instance. You must also add the Bitmap instance to the display list by calling the addChild() or addChildAt() methods of the display object container that will contain the Bitmap instance. For more information on working with the display list, see Adding display objects to the display list.\nThe following example creates a BitmapData object with a red fill, and displays it in a Bitmap instance:\nvar myBitmapDataObject = new BitmapData (150, 150, false, 0xFF0000);\nvar myImage = new Bitmap (myBitmapDataObject);\naddChild (myImage);\n\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/manipulating-pixels.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/manipulating-pixels.html","title":"Manipulating pixels","keywords":"","body":"Manipulating pixels \nThe BitmapData class contains a set of methods that allow you to manipulate pixel data values.\nManipulating individual pixels\nWhen changing the appearance of a bitmap image at a pixel level, you first need to get the color values of the pixels contained within the area you wish to manipulate. You use the getPixel() method to read these pixel values.\nThe getPixel() method retrieves an RGB value from a set of x, y (pixel) coordinates that are passed as a parameter. If any of the pixels that you want to manipulate include transparency (alpha channel) information, you need to use the getPixel32() method. This method also retrieves an RGB value, but unlike with getPixel(), the value returned by getPixel32() contains additional data that represents the alpha channel (transparency) value of the selected pixel.\nAlternatively, if you simply want to change the color or transparency of a pixel contained within a bitmap, you can use the setPixel() or setPixel32() method. To set a pixel’s color, simply pass in the x, y coordinates and the color value to one of these methods.\nThe following example uses setPixel() to draw a cross on a green BitmapData background. It then uses getPixel() to retrieve the color value from the pixel at the coordinate 50, 50 and traces the returned value.\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\n\n...\n\nvar myBitmapData = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x009900);\n\nfor (i in 0...100) {\n\n    var red = 0xFF0000;\n    myBitmapData.setPixel (50, i, red);\n    myBitmapData.setPixel (i, 50, red);\n\n}\n\nvar myBitmapImage = new Bitmap (myBitmapData);\naddChild (myBitmapImage);\n\nvar pixelValue = myBitmapData.getPixel (50, 50);\ntrace (StringTools.hex (pixelValue, 6));\n\nIf you want to read the value of a group of pixels, as opposed to a single pixel, use the getPixels() method. This method generates a byte array from a rectangular region of pixel data that is passed as a parameter. Each of the elements of the byte array (in other words, the pixel values) are unsigned integers—32-bit, unmultiplied pixel values.\nConversely, to change (or set) the value of a group of pixels, use the setPixels() method. This method expects two parameters (rect and inputByteArray), which are combined to output a rectangular region (rect) of pixel data (inputByteArray).\nAs data is read (and written) out of the inputByteArray, the ByteArray.readUnsignedInt() method is called for each of the pixels in the array. If, for some reason, the inputByteArray doesn't contain a full rectangle worth of pixel data, the method stops processing the image data at that point.\nIt's important to remember that, for both getting and setting pixel data, the byte array expects 32-bit alpha, red, green, blue (ARGB) pixel values.\nThe following example uses the getPixels() and setPixels() methods to copy a group of pixels from one BitmapData object to another:\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.utils.ByteArray;\nimport openfl.geom.Rectangle;\n\n...\n\nvar bitmapDataObject1 = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x006666FF);\nvar bitmapDataObject2 = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x00FF0000);\n\nvar rect = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 100);\nvar bytes = bitmapDataObject1.getPixels (rect);\n\nbytes.position = 0;\nbitmapDataObject2.setPixels (rect, bytes);\n\nvar bitmapImage1 = new Bitmap (bitmapDataObject1);\naddChild (bitmapImage1);\nvar bitmapImage2 = new Bitmap (bitmapDataObject2);\naddChild (bitmapImage2);\nbitmapImage2.x = 110;\n\nPixel-level collision detection \nThe BitmapData.hitTest() method performs pixel-level collision detection between the bitmap data and another object or point.\nThe BitmapData.hitTest() method accepts five parameters:\n\nfirstPoint (Point): This parameter refers to the pixel position of the upper-left corner of the first BitmapData upon which the hit test is being performed.\nfirstAlphaThreshold (uint): This parameter specifies the highest alpha channel value that is considered opaque for this hit test.\nsecondObject (Object): This parameter represents the area of impact. The secondObject object can be a Rectangle, Point, Bitmap, or BitmapData object. This object represents the hit area on which the collision detection is being performed.\nsecondBitmapDataPoint (Point): This optional parameter is used to define a pixel location in the second BitmapData object. This parameter is used only when the value of secondObject is a BitmapData object. The default is null.\nsecondAlphaThreshold (uint): This optional parameter represents the highest alpha channel value that is considered opaque in the second BitmapData object. The default value is 1. This parameter is only used when the value of secondObject is a BitmapData object and both BitmapData objects are transparent.\n\nWhen performing collision detection on opaque images, keep in mind that OpenFL treats the image as though it were a fully opaque rectangle (or bounding box). Alternatively, when performing pixel-level hit testing on images that are transparent, both of the images are required to be transparent. In addition to this, OpenFL uses the alpha threshold parameters to determine at what point the pixels change from being transparent to opaque.\nThe following example creates three bitmap images and checks for pixel collision using two different collision points (one returns false, the other true):\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.geom.Point;\n\n...\n\nvar bmd1 = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x000000FF);\nvar bmd2 = new BitmapData (20, 20, false, 0x00FF3300);\n\nvar bm1 = new Bitmap (bmd1);\nthis.addChild (bm1);\n\n// Create a red square.\nvar redSquare1 = new Bitmap (bmd2);\nthis.addChild (redSquare1);\nredSquare1.x = 0;\n\n// Create a second red square.\nvar redSquare2 = new Bitmap (bmd2);\nthis.addChild (redSquare2);\nredSquare2.x = 150;\nredSquare2.y = 150;\n\n// Define the point at the top-left corner of the bitmap.\nvar pt1 = new Point (0, 0);\n\n// Define the point at the center of redSquare1.\nvar pt2 = new Point (20, 20);\n\n// Define the point at the center of redSquare2.\nvar pt3 = new Point (160, 160);\n\ntrace (bmd1.hitTest (pt1, 0xFF, pt2)); // true\ntrace (bmd1.hitTest (pt1, 0xFF, pt3)); // false\n\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/copying-bitmap-data.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/copying-bitmap-data.html","title":"Copying bitmap data","keywords":"","body":"Copying bitmap data \nTo copy bitmap data from one image to another, you can use several methods: clone(), copyPixels(), copyChannel(), draw(), and drawWithQuality().\nAs its name suggests, the clone() method lets you clone, or sample, bitmap data from one BitmapData object to another. When called, the method returns a new BitmapData object that is an exact clone of the original instance it was copied from.\nThe following example clones a copy of an orange (parent) square and places the clone beside the original parent square:\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\n\n...\n\nvar myParentSquareBitmap = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x00ff3300);\nvar myClonedChild = myParentSquareBitmap.clone ();\n\nvar myParentSquareContainer = new Bitmap (myParentSquareBitmap);\nthis.addChild (myParentSquareContainer);\n\nvar myClonedChildContainer = new Bitmap (myClonedChild);\nthis.addChild (myClonedChildContainer);\nmyClonedChildContainer.x = 110;\n\nThe copyPixels() method is a quick and easy way of copying pixels from one BitmapData object to another. The method takes a rectangular snapshot (defined by the sourceRect parameter) of the source image and copies it to another rectangular area (of equal size). The location of the newly \"pasted\" rectangle is defined within the destPoint parameter.\nThe copyChannel() method samples a predefined color channel value (alpha, red, green, or blue) from a source BitmapData object and copies it into a channel of a destination BitmapData object. Calling this method does not affect the other channels in the destination BitmapData object.\nThe draw() and drawWithQuality() methods draw, or render, the graphical content from a source sprite, movie clip, or other display object on to a new bitmap. Using the matrix, colorTransform, blendMode, and destination clipRect parameters, you can modify the way in which the new bitmap is rendered. This method uses the vector renderer in OpenFL to generate the data.\nWhen you call draw() or drawWithQuality(), you pass the source object (sprite, movie clip, or other display object) as the first parameter, as demonstrated here:\nmyBitmap.draw (movieClip);\n\nIf the source object has had any transformations (color, matrix, and so forth) applied to it after it was originally loaded, these transformations are not copied across to the new object. If you want to copy the transformations to the new bitmap, then you need to copy the value of the transform property from the original object to the transform property of the Bitmap object that uses the new BitmapData object.\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/compressing-bitmap-data.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/compressing-bitmap-data.html","title":"Compressing bitmap data","keywords":"","body":"Compressing bitmap data \nThe openfl.display.BitmapData.encode() method lets you natively compress bitmap data into one of the following image compression formats:\n\nPNG - Uses PNG compression, optionally using fast compression, which emphasizes compression speed over file size.

A noise effect can be likened to the static that appears on an untuned television screen.\nTo apply a noise effect to a a bitmap, use the noise() method. This method applies a random color value to pixels within a specified area of a bitmap image.\nThis method accepts five parameters:\n\nrandomSeed (Int): The random seed number that determines the pattern. Despite its name, this number actually creates the same results if the same number is passed. To get a true random result, use the Math.random() method to pass a random number for this parameter.\nlow (Int): This parameter refers to the lowest value to be generated for each pixel (0 to 255). The default value is 0. Setting this value lower results in a darker noise pattern, while setting it to a higher value results in a brighter pattern.\nhigh (Int): This parameter refers to the highest value to be generated for each pixel (0 to 255).

The perlinNoise() method produces realistic, organic textures that are ideal for smoke, clouds, water, fire, or even explosions.\nBecause it is generated by an algorithm, the perlinNoise() method uses less memory than bitmap-based textures. However, it can still have an impact on processor usage, slowing down your content and causing the screen to be redrawn more slowly than the frame rate, especially on older computers. This is mainly due to the floating-point calculations that need to occur to process the perlin noise algorithms.\nThe method accepts nine parameters (the first six are required):\n\nbaseX (Float): Determines the x (size) value of patterns created.\nbaseY (Float): Determines the y (size) value of the patterns created.\nnumOctaves (Int): Number of octaves or individual noise functions to combine to create this noise. Larger numbers of octaves create images with greater detail but also require more processing time.\nrandomSeed (Int): The random seed number works exactly the same way as it does in the noise() function. To get a true random result, use the Math.random() method to pass a random number for this parameter.\nstitch (Bool): If set to true, this method attempts to stitch (or smooth) the transition edges of the image to create seamless textures for tiling as a bitmap fill.\nfractalNoise (Bool): This parameter relates to the edges of the gradients being generated by the method. If set to true, the method generates fractal noise that smooths the edges of the effect. If set to false, it generates turbulence. An image with turbulence has visible discontinuities in the gradient that can make it better approximate sharper visual effects, like flames and ocean waves.\nchannelOptions (Int): The channelOptions parameter works exactly the same way as it does in the noise() method. It specifies to which color channel (of the bitmap) the noise pattern is applied. The number can be a combination of any of the four color channel ARGB values. The default value is 7.\ngrayScale (Bool): The grayScale parameter works exactly the same way as it does in the noise() method. If set to true, it applies the randomSeed value to the bitmap pixels, effectively washing all color out of the image. The default value is false.\noffsets (Array): An array of points that correspond to x and y offsets for each octave. By manipulating the offset values, you can smoothly scroll the layers of the image. Each point in the offset array affects a specific octave noise function. The default value is null.\n\nThe following example creates a 150 x 150 pixel BitmapData object that calls the perlinNoise() method to generate a green and blue cloud effect:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.display.Bitmap;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapData;\nimport openfl.display.BitmapDataChannel;\n\nclass BitmapNoise2 extends Sprite {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        var myBitmapDataObject = new BitmapData (150, 150, false, 0x00FF0000);\n\n        var seed = Math.floor (Math.random () * 100);\n        var channels = BitmapDataChannel.GREEN | BitmapDataChannel.BLUE;\n\n        myBitmapDataObject.perlinNoise (100, 80, 6, seed, false, true, channels, false, null);\n\n        var myBitmap = new Bitmap (myBitmapDataObject);\n        addChild (myBitmap);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n"},"working-with-bitmaps/scrolling-bitmaps.html":{"url":"working-with-bitmaps/scrolling-bitmaps.html","title":"Scrolling bitmaps","keywords":"","body":"Scrolling bitmaps \nImagine you have created a street mapping application where each time the user moves the map you are required to update the view (even if the map has been moved by just a few pixels).\nOne way to create this functionality would be to re-render a new image containing the updated map view each time the user moves the map. Alternatively, you could create a large single image and use the scroll() method.\nThe scroll() method copies an on-screen bitmap and then pastes it to a new offset location—specified by (x, y) parameters. If a portion of the bitmap happens to reside off-stage, this gives the effect that the image has shifted. When combined with a timer function (or an enterFrame event), you can make the image appear to be animating or scrolling.\nThe following example takes the previous perlin noise example and generates a larger bitmap image (three-fourths of which is rendered off-stage). The scroll() method is then applied, along with an enterFrame event listener that offsets the image by one pixel in a diagonally downward direction.

It has all the behaviors and functionality of display objects, but with additional properties and methods for controlling its timeline.\nBasics of movie clips\nMovie clips are a key element for people who create animated content with the Flash authoring tool and want to control that content with Haxe code. Whenever you create a movie clip symbol in Flash, Flash adds the symbol to the library of that Flash document. By default, this symbol becomes an instance of the MovieClip class, and as such has the properties and methods of the MovieClip class.\nWhen an instance of a movie clip symbol is placed on the Stage, the movie clip automatically progresses through its timeline (if it has more than one frame) unless its playback is altered using Haxe code. It is this timeline that distinguishes the MovieClip class, allowing you to create animation through motion or shape tweens through the Flash authoring tool. By contrast, with a display object that is an instance of the Sprite class, you can create animation only by programmatically changing the object’s values.\nIn OpenFL, a movie clip is only one of many display objects that can appear on the screen. If a timeline is not necessary for the function of a display object, using the Shape class or Sprite class in lieu of the MovieClip class may improve rendering performance. For more information on choosing the appropriate display object for a task, see Choosing a DisplayObject subclass.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms related to movie clips:\nAVM1 SWF A project created using ActionScript 1.0 or ActionScript 2.0, usually targeting Flash Player 8 or earlier.\nAVM2 SWF A project created using Haxe or ActionScript 3.0 for Adobe Flash Player 9 or later.\nExternal SWF A SWF file that is created separately from the current project and is intended to be loaded as an asset into the project, whether for Flash Player or on another OpenFL target platform.\nFrame The smallest division of time on the timeline. As with a motion picture filmstrip, each frame is like a snapshot of the animation in time, and when frames are played quickly in sequence, the effect of animation is created.\nTimeline The metaphorical representation of the series of frames that make up a movie clip’s animation sequence. The timeline of a MovieClip object is equivalent to the timeline in the Flash authoring tool.\nPlayhead A marker identifying the location (frame) in the timeline that is being displayed at a given moment.\n"},"working-with-movie-clips/working-with-movieclip-objects.html":{"url":"working-with-movie-clips/working-with-movieclip-objects.html","title":"Working with MovieClip objects","keywords":"","body":"Working with MovieClip objects \nWhen you publish a project, Flash converts all movie clip symbol instances on the Stage to MovieClip objects. You can make a movie clip symbol available to your Haxe code by giving it an instance name in the Instance Name field of the Property inspector. When the project is created, Flash generates the code that creates the MovieClip instance on the Stage and declares a variable using the instance name. If you have named movie clips that are nested inside other named movie clips, those child movie clips are treated like properties of the parent movie clip—you can access the child movie clip using dot syntax. For example, if a movie clip with the instance name childClip is nested within another clip with the instance name parentClip, you can make the child clip’s timeline animation play by calling this code:\nparentClip.childClip.play ();\n\nNote: : Children instances placed on the Stage in the Flash authoring tool cannot be accessed by code from within the constructor of a parent instance since they have not been created at that point in code execution. Before accessing the child, the parent must instead either create the child instance by code or delay access to a callback function that listens for the child to dispatch its Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE event.\nWhile some legacy methods and properties of the ActionScript 2.0 MovieClip class remain the same, others have changed.

For example, _width and _height properties are now accessed as width and height, while _xscale and _yscale are now accessed as scaleX and scaleY. For a complete list of the properties and methods of the MovieClip class, consult the API Reference.\n"},"working-with-movie-clips/controlling-movie-clip-playback.html":{"url":"working-with-movie-clips/controlling-movie-clip-playback.html","title":"Controlling movie clip playback","keywords":"","body":"Controlling movie clip playback \nOpenFL use the metaphor of a timeline to convey animation or a change in state. Any visual element that employs a timeline must be either a MovieClip object or extend from the MovieClip class. While OpenFL can direct any movie clip to stop, play, or go to another point on the timeline, it cannot be used to dynamically create a timeline or add content at specific frames; this is only possible using the Flash authoring tool.\nWhen a MovieClip is playing, it progresses along its timeline at a speed dictated by the frame rate of the project. Alternatively, you can override this setting by setting the Stage.frameRate property in Haxe code.\nPlaying movie clips and stopping playback\nThe play() and stop() methods allow basic control of a movie clip across its timeline. For example, suppose you have a movie clip symbol on the Stage which contains an animation of a bicycle moving across the screen, with its instance name set to bicycle. If the following code is attached to a keyframe on the main timeline,\nbicycle.stop ();\n\nthe bicycle will not move (its animation will not play). The bicycle’s movement could start through some other user interaction. For example, if you had a button named startButton, the following code on a keyframe on the main timeline would make it so that clicking the button causes the animation to play:\n// This function will be called when the button is clicked. It causes the\n// bicycle animation to play.\nprivate function playAnimation (event:MouseEvent):Void {\n\n    bicycle.play ();\n\n}\n\n...\n\n// Register the function as a listener with the button.\nstartButton.addEventListener (MouseEvent.CLICK, playAnimation);\n\nFast-forwarding and rewinding \nThe play() and stop() methods are not the only way of controlling playback in a movie clip. You can also move the playhead forward or backward along the timeline manually by using the nextFrame() and prevFrame() methods. Calling either of these methods stops playback and moves the playhead one frame forward or backward, respectively.\nUsing the play() method is analogous to calling nextFrame() every time the movie clip object’s enterFrame event is triggered. Along these lines, you could make the bicycle movie clip play backwards by creating an event listener for the enterFrame event and telling bicycle to go to its previous frame in the listener function, as follows:\n// This function is called when the enterFrame event is triggered, meaning\n// it's called once per frame.\nprivate function everyFrame (event:Event):Void {\n\n    if (bicycle.currentFrame == 1) {\n\n        bicycle.gotoAndStop (bicycle.totalFrames);\n\n    } else {\n\n        bicycle.prevFrame ();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n...\n\nbicycle.addEventListener (Event.ENTER_FRAME, everyFrame);\n\nIn normal playback, if a movie clip contains more than a single frame, it will loop indefinitely when playing; that is, it will return to Frame 1 if it progresses past its final frame. When you use prevFrame() or nextFrame(), this behavior does not happen automatically (calling prevFrame() when the playhead is on Frame 1 doesn’t move the playhead to the last frame). The if condition in the example above checks to see if the playhead has progressed backwards to the first frame, and sets the playhead ahead to its final frame, effectively creating a continuous loop of the movie clip playing backwards.\nJumping to a different frame and using frame labels \nSending a movie clip to a new frame is a simple affair. Calling either gotoAndPlay() or gotoAndStop() will jump the movie clip to the frame number specified as a parameter. Alternatively, you can pass a string that matches the name of a frame label. Any frame on the timeline can be assigned a label. To do this, select a frame on the timeline and then enter a name in the Frame Label field on the Property inspector.\nThe advantages of using frame labels instead of numbers are particularly evident when creating a complex movie clip. When the number of frames, layers, and tweens in an animation becomes large, consider labeling important frames with explanatory descriptions that represent shifts in the behavior of the movie clip (for example, \"off,\" \"walking,\" or \"running\"). This improves code readability and also provides flexibility, since function calls that go to a labeled frame are pointers to a single reference—the label—rather than a specific frame number. If later on you decide to move a particular segment of the animation to a different frame, you will not need to change your Haxe code as long as you keep the same label for the frames in the new location.\nTo represent frame labels in code, OpenFL includes the FrameLabel class. Each instance of this class represents a single frame label, and has a name property representing the name of the frame label as specified in the Property inspector, and a frame property representing the frame number of the frame where the label is placed on the timeline.\nIn order to get access to the FrameLabel instances associated with a movie clip instance, the MovieClip class includes two properties that directly return FrameLabel objects. The currentLabels property returns an array that consists of all FrameLabel objects across the entire timeline of a movie clip. The currentLabel property returns a string containing the name of the frame label encountered most recently along the timeline.\nSuppose you were creating a movie clip named robot and had labeled the various states of its animation. You could set up a condition that checks the currentLabel property to access the current state of robot, as in the following code:\nif (robot.currentLabel == \"walking\") {\n\n    // do something\n\n}\n\nFlash Player 11.3 added the frameLabel event to the FrameLabel class. You can assign an event handler to the FrameLabel instance that represents a frame label. The event is dispatched when the playhead enters the frame.\nThe following example creates a FrameLabel instance for the second frame label in the Array of frame labels for the MovieClip. It then registers an event handler for the frameLabel event:\nvar myFrameLabel = robot.currentLabels[1];\nmyFrameLabel.addEventListener (Event.FRAME_LABEL, onFrameLabel);\n\n...\n\nprivate function onFrameLabel (e:Event):Void {\n\n    //do something\n\n}\n\n"},"working-with-movie-clips/creating-movieclip-objects-with-haxe.html":{"url":"working-with-movie-clips/creating-movieclip-objects-with-haxe.html","title":"Creating MovieClip objects with Haxe","keywords":"","body":"Creating MovieClip objects with Haxe \nOne way of adding content to the screen in OpenFL is by dragging assets from the library onto the Stage in the Flash authoring environment, but that is not the only workflow. For complex projects, experienced developers commonly prefer to create movie clips programatically. This approach brings several advantages: easier re-use of code, faster compile-time speed, and more sophisticated modifications that are available only to Haxe code.\nThe display list API of OpenFL streamlines the process of dynamically creating MovieClip objects. The ability to instantiate a MovieClip instance directly, separate from the process of adding it to the display list, provides flexibility and simplicity without sacrificing control.\nIn Haxe, when you create a movie clip (or any other display object) instance programatically, it is not visible on the screen until it is added to the display list by calling the addChild() or the addChildAt() method on a display object container. This allows you to create a movie clip, set its properties, and even call methods before it is rendered to the screen. For more information on working with the display list, see Working with display object containers.\nExporting library symbols for Haxe\nBy default, instances of movie clip symbols in a Flash document’s library cannot be dynamically created (that is, created using only Haxe code). This is because each symbol that is exported for use in Haxe adds to the size of your project, and it’s recognized that some symbols might not be intended for use on the stage. For this reason, in order to make a symbol available in Haxe, you must specify that the symbol should be exported for Haxe.\nTo export a symbol for Haxe code:\n\nSelect the symbol in the Library panel and open its Symbol Properties dialog box.\nIf necessary, activate the Advanced settings.\nIn the Linkage section, activate the \"Export for ActionScript\" checkbox. This will activate the Class and Base Class fields, and will also make it available to Haxe when building with OpenFL.\n\nBy default, the Class field is populated with the symbol name, with spaces removed (for example, a symbol named \"Tree House\" would become \"TreeHouse\"). To specify that the symbol should use a custom class for its behavior, enter the full name of the class including its package in this field. If you want to be able to create instances of the symbol in Haxe code, but don’t need to add any additional behavior, you can leave the class name as-is.\nThe Base Class field’s value defaults to openfl.display.MovieClip (which will become openfl.display.MovieClip when including the SWF asset in OpenFL). If you want your symbol to extend the functionality of another customer class, you can specify that class’s name instead, as long as that class extends the Sprite (or MovieClip) class.\n\nPress the OK button to save the changes.\n\nAt this point, if Flash can’t find a linked SWC file or an external ActionScript file with a definition for the specified class (for instance, if you didn’t need to add additional behavior for the symbol), a warning is displayed:\nA definition for this class could not be found in the classpath, so one will be automatically generated in the project upon export.\nYou can disregard this warning if your library symbol does not require unique functionality beyond the functionality of the MovieClip class.\nIf you do not provide a class for your symbol, Flash will create a class for your symbol equivalent to this one:\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.MovieClip;\n\nclass ExampleMovieClip extends MovieClip {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        super ();\n\n    }\n\n}\nIf you do want to add extra Haxe functionality to your symbol, add the appropriate properties and methods to the code structure below. For example, suppose you have a movie clip symbol containing a circle of 50 pixels width and 50 pixels height, and the symbol is specified to be exported for Haxe with a class named Circle. The following code, when placed in a Circle.hx file, extends the MovieClip class and provides the symbol with the additional methods getArea() and getCircumference():\npackage;\n\nimport openfl.display.MovieClip;\n\nclass Circle extends MovieClip {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n        super ();\n\n    }\n\n    public function getArea ():Float {\n\n        // The formula is Pi times the radius squared.\n        return Math.PI * Math.pow ((width / 2), 2);\n\n    }\n\n    public function getCircumference ():Float {\n\n        // The formula is Pi times the diameter.\n        return Math.PI * width;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe following code, placed on a keyframe on Frame 1 of the Flash document, will create an instance of the symbol and display it on the screen:\nvar c = new Circle ();\naddChild (c);\n\ntrace (c.width);\ntrace (c.height);\ntrace (c.getArea ());\ntrace (c.getCircumference ());\n\nThis code demonstrates Haxe-based instantiation as an alternative to dragging individual assets onto the Stage. It creates a circle that has all of the properties of a movie clip and also has the custom methods defined in the Circle class. This is a very basic example—your library symbol can specify any number of properties and methods in its class.\nHaxe-based instantiation is powerful, because it allows you to dynamically create large quantities of instances that would be tedious to arrange manually. It is also flexible, because you can customize each instance’s properties as it is created. You can get a sense of both of these benefits by using a loop to dynamically create several Circle instances. With the Circle symbol and class described previously in your Flash document’s library, place the following code on a keyframe on Frame 1:\nimport openfl.geom.ColorTransform;\n\n...\n\nvar totalCircles = 10;\n\nfor (i in 0...totalCircles) {\n\n    // Create a new Circle instance.\n    var c = new Circle ();\n\n    // Place the new Circle at an x coordinate that will space the circles\n    // evenly across the Stage.\n    c.x = (stage.stageWidth / totalCircles) * i;\n\n    // Place the Circle instance at the vertical center of the Stage.\n    c.y = stage.stageHeight / 2;\n\n    // Change the Circle instance to a random color\n    c.transform.colorTransform = getRandomColor ();\n\n    // Add the Circle instance to the current timeline.\n    addChild (c);\n\n}\n\n...\n\nprivate function getRandomColor ():ColorTransform {\n\n    // Generate random values for the red, green, and blue color channels.\n    var red = (Math.random () * 512) - 255;\n    var green = (Math.random() * 512) - 255;\n    var blue = (Math.random() * 512) - 255;\n\n    // Create and return a ColorTransform object with the random colors.\n    return new ColorTransform (1, 1, 1, 1, red, green, blue, 0);\n\n}\n\nThis demonstrates how you can create and customize multiple instances of a symbol quickly using code. Each instance is positioned based on the current count within the loop, and each instance is given a random color by setting its transform property (which Circle inherits by extending the MovieClip class).\n"},"working-with-sound/":{"url":"working-with-sound/","title":"Chapter 24: Working with sound","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 24: Working with sound \nOpenFL is made for immersive, interactive applications—and one often overlooked\nelement of powerfully immersive applications is sound.

The\nSound class is the class you\nuse to get access to audio information by loading a sound file or assigning a\nfunction to an event that samples sound data and then starting playback. Once\nyou start playing a sound, OpenFL gives you access to a\nSoundChannel object.\nSince an audio file that you've loaded may only be one of several sounds that\nyou play on a user's computer, each individual sound that's playing uses its own\nSoundChannel object; the combined output of all the SoundChannel objects mixed\ntogether is what actually plays over the computer's speakers. You use this\nSoundChannel instance to control properties of the sound and to stop its\nplayback. Finally, if you want to control the combined audio, the SoundMixer\nclass gives you control over the mixed output.\nYou can also use several other classes to perform more specific tasks when\nyou're working with sound in OpenFL; for more information on all the\nsound-related classes, see\nUnderstanding the sound architecture.\nImportant concepts and terms\nThe following reference list contains important terms that you may encounter:\nAmplitudeThe distance of a point on the sound waveform from the zero or equilibrium line.\nBit rateThe amount of data that is encoded or streamed for each second of a sound file.\nFor mp3 files, the bit rate is usually stated in terms of thousands of bits per\nsecond (kbps).

An\napplication can't reuse a Sound object to load more than one sound. If it wants\nto load a new sound resource, it should create a new Sound object.\nIf you are loading a small sound file, such as a click sound to be attached to a\nbutton, your application can create a new Sound and have it automatically load\nthe sound file, as shown below:\nvar req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"click.mp3\");\nvar s:Sound = new Sound(req);\n\nThe Sound() constructor accepts a URLRequest object as its first parameter.\nWhen a value for the URLRequest parameter is supplied, the new Sound object\nstarts loading the specified sound resource automatically.\nIn all but the simplest cases, your application should pay attention to the\nsound's loading progress and watch for errors during loading. For example, if\nthe click sound is fairly large, it might not be completely loaded by the time\nthe user clicks the button that triggers the sound. Trying to play an unloaded\nsound could cause a run-time error. It's safer to wait for the sound to load\ncompletely before letting users take actions that might start sounds playing.\nA Sound object dispatches a number of different events during the sound loading\nprocess. Your application can listen for these events to track loading progress\nand make sure that the sound loads completely before playing. The following\ntable lists the events that can be dispatched by a Sound object.\n\n\n\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nopen (Event.OPEN)\nDispatched right before the sound loading operation begins.\n\n\nprogress (ProgressEvent.PROGRESS)\nDispatched periodically during the sound loading process when data is received from the file or stream.\n\n\nid3 (Event.ID3)\nDispatched when ID3 data is available for an mp3 sound.\n\n\ncomplete (Event.COMPLETE)\nDispatched when all of the sound resource's data has been loaded.\n\n\nioError (IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR)\nDispatched when a sound file cannot be located or when the loading process is interrupted before all sound data can be received.\n\n\n\nThe following code illustrates how to play a sound after it has finished\nloading:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass LoadAndPlaySoundExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var s:Sound = new Sound();\n        s.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onSoundLoaded);\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        s.load(req);\n    }\n\n    function onSoundLoaded(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var localSound:Sound = cast(event.target, Sound);\n        localSound.play();\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, the code sample creates a new Sound object without giving it an initial\nvalue for the URLRequest parameter. Then, it listens for the Event.COMPLETE\nevent from the Sound object, which causes the onSoundLoaded() method to\nexecute when all the sound data is loaded. Next, it calls the Sound.load()\nmethod with a new URLRequest value for the sound file.\nThe onSoundLoaded() method executes when the sound loading is complete. The\ntarget property of the Event object is a reference to the Sound object.\nCalling the play() method of the Sound object then starts the sound playback.\nMonitoring the sound loading process\nSound files can be very large and take a long time to load. While OpenFL lets\nyour application play sounds even before they are fully loaded, you might want\nto give the user an indication of how much of the sound data has been loaded and\nhow much of the sound has already been played.\nThe Sound class dispatches two events that make it relatively easy to display\nthe loading progress of a sound: ProgressEvent.PROGRESS and Event.COMPLETE.\nThe following example shows how to use these events to display progress\ninformation about the sound being loaded:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.events.IOErrorEvent;\nimport openfl.events.ProgressEvent;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass SoundLoadProgressExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var s:Sound = new Sound();\n        s.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onLoadProgress);\n        s.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onLoadComplete);\n        s.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, onIOError);\n\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        s.load(req);\n    }\n\n    function onLoadProgress(event:ProgressEvent):Void\n    {\n        var loadedPct = Math.round(100 * (event.bytesLoaded / event.bytesTotal));\n        trace(\"The sound is \" + loadedPct + \"% loaded.\");\n    }\n\n    function onLoadComplete(event:Event):Void\n    {\n        var localSound:Sound = cast(event.target, Sound);\n        localSound.play();\n    }\n\n    function onIOError(event:IOErrorEvent):Void\n    {\n        trace(\"The sound could not be loaded: \" + event.text);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code first creates a Sound object and then adds listeners to that object\nfor the ProgressEvent.PROGRESS and Event.COMPLETE events. After the\nSound.load() method has been called and the first data is received from the\nsound file, a ProgressEvent.PROGRESS event occurs and triggers the\nonSoundLoadProgress() method.\nThe percentage of the sound data that has been loaded is equal to the value of\nthe bytesLoaded property of the ProgressEvent object divided by the value of\nthe bytesTotal property. The same bytesLoaded and bytesTotal properties\nare available on the Sound object as well. The example above simply shows\nmessages about the sound loading progress, but you can easily use the\nbytesLoaded and bytesTotal values to update progress bar components, such as\nthe ones that come with libraries like Haxe UI or\nFeathers UI.\nThis example also shows how an application can recognize and respond to an error\nwhen loading sound files. For example, if a sound file with the given filename\ncannot be located, an Event.IO_ERROR event is dispatched by the Sound object.\nIn the previous code, the onIOError() method executes and displays a brief\nerror message when an error occurs.\n"},"working-with-sound/working-with-sound-assets.html":{"url":"working-with-sound/working-with-sound-assets.html","title":"Working with sound assets","keywords":"","body":"Working with sound assets \nUsing sound assets, instead of loading sounds from a web URL or a file system\npath, is another possibility for playing audio.

You can generate audio data when you assign an event listener for\nthe sampleData event of a Sound object. (The sampleData event is defined in\nthe SampleDataEvent class in the\nopenfl.events package.) In\nthis environment, the Sound object doesn't load sound data from a file. Instead,\nit acts as a socket for sound data that is being streamed to it through the use\nof the function you assign to this event.\nWhen you add a sampleData event listener to a Sound object, the object\nperiodically requests data to add to the sound buffer. This buffer contains data\nfor the Sound object to play. When you call the play() method of the Sound\nobject, it dispatches the sampleData event when requesting new sound data.\n(This is true only when the Sound object has not loaded mp3, ogg, or wav data\nfrom a file.)\nThe SampleDataEvent object includes a data property. In your event listener,\nyou write ByteArray objects to this data object. The byte arrays you write to\nthis object add to buffered sound data that the Sound object plays. The byte\narray in the buffer is a stream of floating-point values from -1 to 1. Each\nfloating-point value represents the amplitude of one channel (left or right) of\na sound sample. Sound is sampled at 44,100 samples per second. Each sample\ncontains a left and right channel, interleaved as floating-point data in the\nbyte array.\nIn your handler function, you use the ByteArray.writeFloat() method to write\nto the data property of the sampleData event. For example, the following\ncode generates a sine wave:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.SampleDataEvent;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\n\nclass SineWaveSample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var mySound:Sound = new Sound();\n        mySound.addEventListener(SampleDataEvent.SAMPLE_DATA, sineWaveGenerator);\n        mySound.play();\n    }\n\n    function sineWaveGenerator(event:SampleDataEvent):Void\n    {\n        for (i in 0...8192)\n        {\n            var n = Math.sin((i + event.position) / Math.PI / 4);\n            event.data.writeFloat(n);\n            event.data.writeFloat(n);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhen you call Sound.play(), the application starts calling your event handler,\nrequesting sound sample data. The application continues to send events as the\nsound plays back until you stop providing data, or until you call\nSoundChannel.stop().\nThe latency of the event varies from platform to platform, and could change in\nfuture versions of OpenFL. Do not depend on a specific latency; calculate it\ninstead. To calculate the latency, use the following formula:\n(SampleDataEvent.position / 44.1) - SoundChannelObject.position\nProvide from 2048 through 8192 samples to the data property of the\nSampleDataEvent object (for each call to the event listener). For best\nperformance, provide as many samples as possible (up to 8192). The fewer samples\nyou provide, the more likely it is that clicks and pops will occur during\nplayback. This behavior can differ on various platforms and can occur in various\nsituations—for example, when resizing the browser.

You can record the position of\nthe sound at the time it was stopped, and then replay the sound starting at that\nposition later.\nFor example, let's say your code loads and plays a sound file like this:\nvar snd:Sound = new Sound(new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\"));\nvar channel:SoundChannel = snd.play();\n\nWhile the sound plays, the SoundChannel.position property indicates the point\nin the sound file that is currently being played. Your application can store the\nposition value before stopping the sound from playing, as follows:\nvar pausePosition = channel.position;\nchannel.stop();\n\nTo resume playing the sound, pass the previously stored position value to\nrestart the sound from the same point it stopped at before.\nchannel = snd.play(pausePosition);\n\nMonitoring playback\nYour application might want to know when a sound stops playing so it can start\nplaying another sound, or clean up some resources used during the previous\nplayback. The SoundChannel class dispatches an Event.SOUND_COMPLETE event when\nits sound finishes playing. Your application can listen for this event and take\nappropriate action, as shown below:\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.media.SoundChannel;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass SoundCompleteEventExample extends Sprite {\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var snd:Sound = new Sound();\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"smallSound.mp3\");\n        snd.load(req);\n\n        var channel:SoundChannel = snd.play();\n        channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlaybackComplete);\n    }\n\n    function onPlaybackComplete(event:Event):Void {\n        trace(\"The sound has finished playing.\");\n    }\n}\n\nThe SoundChannel class does not dispatch progress events during playback. To\nreport on playback progress, your application can set up its own timing\nmechanism and track the position of the sound playhead.\nTo calculate what percentage of a sound has been played, you can divide the\nvalue of the SoundChannel.position property by the length of the sound data\nthat's being played:\nvar playbackPercent = 100.0 * (channel.position / snd.length);\n\nHowever, this code only reports accurate playback percentages if the sound data\nwas fully loaded before playback began. The Sound.length property shows the\nsize of the sound data that is currently loaded, not the eventual size of the\nentire sound file. To track the playback progress of a streaming sound that is\nstill loading, your application should estimate the eventual size of the full\nsound file and use that value in its calculations. You can estimate the eventual\nlength of the sound data using the bytesLoaded and bytesTotal properties of\nthe Sound object, as follows:\nvar estimatedLength = Math.ceil(snd.length / (snd.bytesLoaded / snd.bytesTotal));\nvar playbackPercent = 100.0 * (channel.position / estimatedLength);\n\nThe following code loads a larger sound file and uses the Event.ENTER_FRAME\nevent as its timing mechanism for showing playback progress. It periodically\nreports on the playback percentage, which is calculated as the current position\nvalue divided by the total length of the sound data:\nimport openfl.media.SoundChannel;\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass SoundProgressEventExample extends Sprite {\n    private var snd:Sound;\n    private var channel:SoundChannel;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        snd = new Sound();\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        snd.load(req);\n\n        channel = snd.play();\n        addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n        channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlaybackComplete);\n    }\n\n    function onEnterFrame(event:Event):Void {\n        var estimatedLength:Int = Math.ceil(snd.length / (snd.bytesLoaded / snd.bytesTotal));\n        var playbackPercent:Int = Math.round(100 * (channel.position / estimatedLength));\n        trace(\"Sound playback is \" + playbackPercent + \"% complete.\");\n    }\n\n    function onPlaybackComplete(event:Event):Void {\n        trace(\"The sound has finished playing.\");\n        removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n    }\n}\n\nAfter the sound data starts loading, this code calls the snd.play() method and\nstores the resulting SoundChannel object in the channel variable. Then it adds\nan event listener to the main application for the Event.ENTER_FRAME event and\nanother event listener to the SoundChannel object for the Event.SOUND_COMPLETE\nevent that occurs when playback is complete.\nEach time the application reaches a new frame in its animation, the\nonEnterFrame() method is called. The onEnterFrame() method estimates the\ntotal length of the sound file based on the amount of data that has already been\nloaded, and then it calculates and displays the current playback percentage.\nWhen the entire sound has been played, the onPlaybackComplete() method\nexecutes, removing the event listener for the Event.ENTER_FRAME event so that\nit doesn't try to display progress updates after playback is done.\nThe Event.ENTER_FRAME event can be dispatched many times per second. In some\ncases, you won't want to display playback progress that frequently. In those\ncases, your application can set up its own timing mechanism using the\nopenfl.utils.Timer class.\nStopping streaming sounds\nThere is a quirk in the playback process for sounds that are streaming—that is,\nfor sounds that are still loading while they are being played. When your\napplication calls the SoundChannel.stop() method on a SoundChannel instance\nthat is playing back a streaming sound, the sound playback stops for one frame,\nand then on the next frame, it restarts from the beginning of the sound. This\noccurs because the sound loading process is still underway. To stop both the\nloading and the playback of a streaming sound, call the Sound.close() method.\n"},"working-with-sound/controlling-sound-volume-and-panning.html":{"url":"working-with-sound/controlling-sound-volume-and-panning.html","title":"Controlling sound volume and panning","keywords":"","body":"Controlling sound volume and panning \nAn individual\nSoundChannel object\ncontrols both the left and the right stereo channels for a sound. If a sound is\nmonaural, the left and right stereo channels of the SoundChannel object will\ncontain identical waveforms.\nYou can find out the amplitude of each stereo channel of the sound being played\nusing the leftPeak and rightPeak properties of the SoundChannel object.\nThese properties show the peak amplitude of the sound waveform itself. They do\nnot represent the actual playback volume. The actual playback volume is a\nfunction of the amplitude of the sound wave and the volume values set in the\nSoundChannel object.\n\nThe pan property of a SoundChannel object can be used to specify a different\nvolume level for each of the left and right channels during playback. The pan\nproperty can have a value ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 means the left channel\nplays at top volume while the right channel is silent, and 1 means the right\nchannel plays at top volume while the left channel is silent. Numeric values in\nbetween -1 and 1 set proportional values for the left and right channel values,\nand a value of 0 means that both channels play at a balanced, mid-volume level.\nThe following code example creates a SoundTransform object with a volume value\nof 0.6 and a pan value of -1 (top left channel volume and no right channel\nvolume). It passes the SoundTransform object as a parameter to the play()\nmethod, which applies that SoundTransform object to the new SoundChannel object\nthat is created to control the playback.\nvar snd:Sound = new Sound(new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\"));\nvar trans:SoundTransform = new SoundTransform(0.6, -1);\nvar channel:SoundChannel = snd.play(0, 1, trans);\n\nYou can alter the volume and panning while a sound is playing by setting the\npan or volume properties of a SoundTransform object and then applying that\nobject as the soundTransform property of a SoundChannel object.\n\n\nThe following example alternates the panning of the sound from the left channel\nto the right channel and back while the sound plays.\nimport openfl.display.Sprite;\nimport openfl.events.Event;\nimport openfl.media.Sound;\nimport openfl.media.SoundChannel;\nimport openfl.media.SoundTransform;\nimport openfl.net.URLRequest;\n\nclass PanningSoundExample extends Sprite {\n    private var trans:SoundTransform;\n    private var channel:SoundChannel;\n    private var panCounter:Float = 0;\n\n    public function new() {\n        super();\n\n        var snd:Sound = new Sound();\n        var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(\"bigSound.mp3\");\n        snd.load(req);\n\n        trans = new SoundTransform(1, 0);\n        channel = snd.play(0, 1, trans);\n        channel.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlaybackComplete);\n\n        addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n    }\n\n    function onEnterFrame(event:Event):Void {\n        trans.pan = Math.sin(panCounter);\n        channel.soundTransform = trans;\n        panCounter += 0.05;\n    }\n\n    function onPlaybackComplete(event:Event):Void {\n        removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n    }\n}\n\nThis code starts by loading a sound file and then creating a new SoundTransform\nobject with volume set to 1 (full volume) and pan set to 0 (evenly balanced\nbetween left and right). Then it calls the snd.play() method, passing the\nSoundTransform object as a parameter.\nWhile the sound plays, the onEnterFrame() method executes repeatedly. The\nonEnterFrame() method uses the Math.sin() function to generate a value\nbetween -1 and 1, a range that corresponds to the acceptable values of the\nSoundTransform.pan property. The SoundTransform object's pan property is set\nto the new value, and then the channel's soundTransform property is set to use\nthe altered SoundTransform object.\nTo run this example, replace the filename bigSound.mp3 with the name of a local\nmp3 file. Then run the example. You should hear the left channel volume getting\nlouder while the right channel volume gets softer, and vice versa.\n\n"}}}
