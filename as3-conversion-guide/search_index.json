History","keywords":"","body":"A Short History\nIn 2001, the popularity of Flash and ActionScript continued to grow as artists and developers discovered the infinite possibilities of an expressive web platform.\nUnfortunately, the only method available for compiling Actionscript was to use the Macromedia Flash editor, or to use Macromedia's server-side Generator product. There were no free ActionScript compilers, particularly open-source ones, until Nicolas Cannasse and Motion-Twin created MTASC, the \"Motion Twin ActionScript Compiler\"\nTools like MTASC, swfmill and other open-souce Flash resources grew in popularity. Fast-forward in time, Macromedia began releasing alpha previews of ActionScript 3.0 and the new ActionScript virtual machine (AVM2). This time, Macromedia did promise a free compiler (in the form of the Flex SDK). Rather than create a redundant solution for compiling ActionScript 3.0, Nicolas instead worked on a new programming language, inspired by ActionScript, but designed from day one to cross-compile to multiple target runtimes. Haxe was created, generating AVM2 bytecode directly (similar to ActionScript 3.0) but also compatible with JavaScript and PHP for client- and server-side programming.\nToday, Haxe has grown to support more than ten output targets, including mature support for C++ and broad support for Java or C#, and is used successfully in many projects from embedded set-top boxes to the mobile web, desktop games and game console development. Haxe continues to get better, and with the explosion of devices since Flash was first created, the need and power of a cross-target solution becomes all the more essential.\nDeclining Browser Support\nBrowser support for the Flash Player plugin has been in decline since smartphones increased in popularity. What was possible only through a plugin is now largely possible through the web browser, so there has been a steady increase in pressure to discontinue support for the Netscape plugin architecture (NPAPI) in favor of browser-based solutions.\nFlash has received a lot of negative press that fundamentally comes down to declining browser plugin support. The Unity Web Player, for example, has been subject to the same pressure.\nFlash, not Flash Player\n\"Flash\" and \"Flash Player\" are inseparable terms for many people, but the open-source community makes the argument that these can be completely separate.\nWithout Flash Player, there is no ActionScript virtual machine. Especially in the web browser, choices are limited to V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra or another JavaScript virtual machine. In Haxe, AVM2 and JavaScript are both fully supported. Using OpenFL, an open implementation of Flash APIs, it is possible to develop \"Flash\" content without using Flash Player at all.\nBeyond the browser, Flash Player is available in the form of Adobe AIR for desktop and mobile, but there are still limitations that prevent developers from creating Linux native applications, releasing for console platforms, or integrating with deeper features than are provided. OpenFL also includes support for native desktop and mobile publishing, and unofficially has been used in embedded devices, console platforms and single-board computers (such as the Raspberry Pi).\n"},"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/":{"url":"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/","title":"Comparing Haxe and ActionScript","keywords":"","body":"Comparing Haxe and ActionScript\nSince the Haxe programming language originated from an ActionScript 2.0 compiler, there are many similarities between the languages. In fact, a number of the minor differences between ActionScript 3.0 and Haxe can be explained if you understand this heritage.\nHowever, as you look deeper, you will find that Haxe is a modern, strictly-typed language that takes inspiration from many of the best parts of ActionScript while adding many new and valuable features.\n"},"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/overview.html":{"url":"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/overview.html","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":"Overview\nDeclaring a Class\nHaxe and ActionScript 2.0 follow a similar structure when declaring a new class. Similar to ActionScript 2.0, package is optional if a class file is located in the top-level of a source directory, but the package must match the file path if it is used in a sub-directory.\nThe constructor function in Haxe is called new, while in ActionScript, it matches the class name. Declaring public on a constructor in optional in Haxe, and private constructors are supported (unlike ActionScript).\nActionScript 2.0\npackage;\n\nclass Test {\n\n    function Test () {\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nActionScript 3.0\npackage {\n\n    public class Test {\n\n        public function Test () {\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nHaxe\npackage;\n\nclass Test {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nCore Types\nIn ActionScript 2.0 the core data types are capitalized. Haxe follows this pattern, and goes further to specify that all package names must be lowercase, and all types must start with an uppercase letter (such as \"com.example.ClassName\").\nHaxe uses Float and Int as core types, which are similar to Number and int in ActionScript. Haxe uses Dynamic to describe a wildcard type, similar to the ActionScript * type, and close to the ActionScript Object type.\nActionScript 2.0\nString\nNumber\nBoolean\nObject\nVoid\n\nActionScript 3.0\nString\nNumber\nint\nBoolean\nString\nObject\nvoid\n\nHaxe\nString\nFloat\nInt\nBool\nDynamic\nVoid\n\nProperty Access\nHaxe expands upon the get/set functionality of ActionScript to provide nuanced property access support. For example, a read-only variable can be declared without a getter and an extra variable.\nWhen defining a getter or a setter function, Haxe requires the \"get_\" or \"set_\" prefix. This helps reflection work more easily, and ensures consisten behavior, even on environments that do not support getters and setters natively.\nActionScript 3.0\nprivate var _customSetter:String;\nprivate var _readOnly:Number;\n\npublic get function customSetter ():String {\n\n    return _customSetter;\n\n}\n\npublic set function customSetter (value:String):void {\n\n    _customSetter = value + \"!\";\n\n}\n\npublic get function readOnly ():Number {\n\n    return _readOnly;\n\n}\n\nHaxe\npublic var customSetter (default, set):String;\npublic var readOnly (default, null):Float;\n\nprivate function set_customSetter (value:String):String {\n\n    return this.customSetter = value + \"!\";\n\n}\n\nNamespaces\nActionScript 3.0 supports namespaces, both public and private (similar to ActionScript 2.0) in addition to internal, protected or custom namespaces. Haxe supports only public and private (with private behaving similar to ActionScript's protected namespace) and does not support custom namespaces.\nHowever, Haxe does support access control using meta-data tags such as @:allow and @:access for private access. \nActionScript 3.0\npackage {\n\n    public class Test {\n\n        internal static var hello:String = \"Hello\";\n\n    }\n\n}\n\npackage {\n\n    public class Test2 {\n\n        public function Test2 () {\n\n            var msg:String = Test.hello;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nHaxe\nclass Test {\n\n    private static var hello:String = \"Hello\";\n\n}\n\n@:access(Test)\npublic class Test2 {\n\n    function new () {\n\n        var msg = Test.hello;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nType Inference\nDeclaring the type for a variable is optional in ActionScript 2.0, but required when statically typing variables in ActionScript 3.0. This enables faster performance by knowing the type of a variable at compile-time.\nHaxe supports compiler type inference, a valuable feature that allows you to eliminate boiler-plate code, while enjoying the benefits of static typing. It is also possible to add type declarations similar to ActionScript.\nActionScript 3.0\nvar hello:String = \"World\";\nvar fruit:Array = [ \"apple\", \"orange\" ];\n\nHaxe\nvar hello:String = \"World\";\nvar fruit:Array = [ \"apple\", \"orange\" ];\n\nor\nvar hello = \"World\";\nvar fruit = [ \"apple\", \"orange\" ];\n\nLoops\nActionScript has multiple kinds of loops. There for ... in loops, for ... each loops and for loops. Haxe simplifies this syntax to a single for ... in loop:\nActionScript 3.0\nfor (var i:uint = 0; i \nHaxe\nfor (i in 0...10) {\n\n    trace (i);\n\n}\n\nvar array = [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" ];\n\nfor (value in array) {\n\n    trace (value);\n\n}\n\n"},"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/":{"url":"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/","title":"Deep Dive","keywords":"","body":"Deep Dive\nBeyond the more superficial differences, in the following chapters we will try to go deep into the syntax and behavior of Haxe and ActionScript, drawing comparisons where we can.\nAlthough we will be introducing new and powerful features of the Haxe programming language that are not available in ActionScript, the focus is on converting ActionScript to working Haxe code, so many of these topics will not be covered thoroughly, or may not be mentioned at all.\nThe Haxe Manual is an excellent resource for understanding Haxe more deeply, particularly features that are not supported in ActionScript, such as enum, typedef, generics, type parameters, macros, abstracts... the list goes on.\nThe Haxe language is not unlike a hardware store. If you need to hang a picture frame in your home, you will only scratch the surface of all the tools and supplies available, but this is alright. Translating from ActionScript to Haxe, I recommend that after you feel comfortable with Haxe, take a look at some of the features available, but do not feel obligated to begin using them all.\nThe board game \"Othello\" has this slogan, which is appropriate:\n\nA Minute to Learn... A Lifetime to Master\n\nSo enjoy this process, and do not feel any pressure to go and try to master advanced features which are awesome, but like the hardware store, are designed for that one time where you really need it, not the day-in, day-out \"hammer and nail\" work.\n"},"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/syntax.html":{"url":"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/syntax.html","title":"Syntax","keywords":"","body":"Syntax\nCase Sensitivity\nActionScript 3.0 and Haxe are both case-sensitive languages, so both of the following are different variables:\nvar hello:String;\nvar Hello:String;\n\nSemicolons\nActionScript 3.0 and Haxe both use semicolons (;) to terminate a statement. Good coding standards in ActionScript encourage the use of semicolons, but they are optional.\nIn Haxe, the use of semicolons is not optional.\nvar hello:String; // correct\nvar hello:String // incorrect\n\nParentheses\nIn ActionScript 3.0, parentheses (()) can be used in three ways, but only two of these are valid in Haxe.\nYou can use parentheses to group operations:\ntrace (1 + (2 * 3)); // 7\ntrace ((1 + 2) * 3); // 9\n\nYou can also use parentheses to pass one or more parameters to functions or methods:\ntrace (\"hello\");\n\nActionScript also supports the use of commas to separate multiple expressions and return the result of the final expression. For example:\nvar a:int = 1;\nvar b:int = 2;\ntrace ((a++, b++, a + b)); // 5\n\nThe above syntax can be confusing, and is not supported in Haxe. The same code can be handled by expanding the expression:\nvar a = 1;\nvar b = 2;\na++;\nb++;\ntrace (a + b);\n\n...or using a function:\nvar a = 1;\nvar b = 2;\ntrace (function () { a++; b++; return a + b; } ());\n\nCode Blocks\nCode encased by curly braces ({}) are called a code block. The body of many portions of ActionScript and Haxe are grouped together using code blocks.\npublic function hello ():String {\n\n    return \"World\";\n\n}\n\nif (raining) {\n\n    useUmbrella ();\n\n}\n\nWhitespace\nSpaces, tabs and line breaks are referred to as whitespace. Actionscript and Haxe both allow whitespace to make code easier to read.\nclass Test {\n\n    public function new () {\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass Test2 { public function new() {} }\n\nComments\nActionscript and Haxe both allow for single-line or multi-line comments. A comment will not be compiled, allowing the addition of helpful notes or as a method of quickly disabling code.\n// This is a single line comment\n\n/* This is\n   a multi-line\n   comment */\n\nLiterals\nA literal is a fixed value in your code, Haxe and ActionScript are similar in the types of literals you can use:\n100\n-2.1\n\"hello\"\nnull\ntrue\nfalse\n\nActionScript has an undefined literal which is not used in Haxe. The following returns undefined in ActionScript, but is a compile error in Haxe:\nobject = { a: \"b\", c: \"d\" };\ntrace (object.e);\n\nInstead, use the Haxe Reflect class to check if a field exists, or use static types.\nif (Reflect.hasField (object, \"e\")) {\n\n    trace (Reflect.field (object, \"e\"));\n\n}\n\nSquare Brackets\nIn ActionScript and Haxe, square brackets ([]) can be used to define an array literal:\nvar colors = [ \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\" ];\n\nSquare brackets can also be used to access array values:\nvar firstColor = colors[0];\n\nHaxe allows support for array access on user-created abstract objects, in addition to core types.\nActionScript also allows the use of square brackets to access fields using a string-based name, but this is not supported in Haxe. Use the Reflect class in Haxe in order to reference a field dynamically.\nActionScript 3.0\nclip.x = 100;\nclip[\"y\"] = 100;\n\nHaxe\nclip.x = 100;\nReflect.setField (clip, \"y\", 100);\n\nAngle Brackets\nActionScript 3.0 uses angle brackets (<>) for the Vector.<>. Haxe provides support for type parameters in the Array<>, Map<> and multiple other types in the language, and allows use of type parameters in user classes as well.\nWhen describing the type of an Array, ActionScript will always treat the array as if it is dynamic. In Haxe, arrays are typed based on their contents, which improves performance and can eliminate confusing errors:\nvar values:Array = [ 0, 1, 2, 5 ];\nvar names:Array = [ \"Doug\", \"Richard\", \"Harrison\" ];\n\nArrow Tokens\nHaxe supports a special arrow token (->) syntax, which is used when describing a function. The ActionScript does not allow for different types based on the signature of a function. Instead, every function in ActionScript is described as type Function. Haxe allows for Dynamic to describe any function, but uses \"arrow tokens\" when a function signature is described specifically. For example, a function that accepts a Bool and returns an Int would be described as Bool->Int, and a function that accepts two boolean arguments instead would be Bool->Bool->Int\nprivate function onMouseDown (x:Float, y:Float):Void {\n\n}\n\nvar handler:Float->Float->Void = onMouseDown;\nhandler (100, 100);\n\nKeywords\nActionScript and Haxe share many reserved words and keywords:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreak\ncase\ncatch\n\n\nclass\ncontinue\ndefault\n\n\ndo\ndynamic\nelse\n\n\nextends\nfalse\nfor\n\n\nfunction\nif\nimplements\n\n\nimport\nin\ninterface\n\n\nnew\nnull\noverride\n\n\npackage\nprivate\npublic\n\n\nreturn\nstatic\nsuper\n\n\nswitch\nthis\nthrow\n\n\ntrue\ntry\nvar\n\n\nwhile\n\n\n\nThe Haxe programming language is designed to limit the number of keywords, so there are a number of keywords which are in ActionScript 3.0 that are not keywords in Haxe:\n\nas\n In ActionScript 3.0, as is used for casting. Adobe references cast as a \"future\" keyword that has not been implemented in the language.\n var clip:MovieClip = event.currentTarget as MovieClip;\n\n Haxe uses cast when casting between types, in order to perform a safe cast (which is slower, but throws an error if it is not possible), use parentheses:\n var clip = cast (event.currentTarget, MovieClip);\n\n ...otherwise, an unsafe cast occurs without parentheses and a second argument.\n var clip:MovieClip = cast event.currentTarget;\n\n\nconst\n Actionscript uses the const keyword to define a constant value. Because Haxe supports inlining, a const keyword is not necessary.\n public static inline var gravity = 9.8;\n\n\neach\n ActionScript has separate \"for in\" or \"for each in\" loops, but in Haxe these are simplified to a single \"for in\" loop.\n var fruits = [ \"apple\", \"pear\", \"orange\" ];\n\n for (fruit in fruits) {\n\n     trace (value);\n\n }\n\n If you need to iterate over the names of the fields in an object, use Reflect.fields:\n ```haxe\n var object = { a: \"b\", c: \"d\" };\n for (field in Reflect.fields (object)) {\n trace (field); // returns \"a\" then \"c\"\n }\n ```haxe\n\nfinal\n ActionScript uses the final keyword to specify a class that cannot be extended. Haxe supports the same, but it uses a @:final meta-data tag instead:\n @:final class Test {\n\n }\n\n\nfinally\n Haxe does not support try/catch/finally so cleanup logic must occur inside a catch in addition to after the try/catch statement.\n\ninclude\n Haxe does not support an include keyword, there are methods of replicating the same behavior using a custom macro, but in general, it is recommended that classes, typedefs, using and other techniques are implemented to share code within a project.\n\ninstanceof\n The ActionScript 3.0 keyword, instanceof, can be replaced with Std.is\n trace (Std.is (sprite, DisplayObject));\n trace (Std.is (\"hello\", String));\n trace (Std.is (5, Int));\n\n\ninternal\n Haxe has support for both public and private keywords, which are simpler to understand, and cover the majority of use cases.\n Haxe supports three meta-data tags (@:allow, @:access and @:privateAccess) which each provide different methods of accessing a private member. This can provide the same function as internal, or like \"friend classes\" in other languages.\n class Secret {\n\n     private var password:String;\n\n }\n\n @:access(Secret)\n class Login {\n\n     public function new () {\n\n         var password = Secret.password;\n\n     }\n\n }\n\n\nnamespace\n Haxe does not support custom namespaces like ActionScript 3.0.\n\nnative\n ActionScript has a native keyword when a method is a wrapper around a native method. Haxe has extern classes for working with native APIs, and depending on the platform, \"CFFI\" or \"JNI\" for accessing methods or properties between different runtime environments.\n On HTML5, it is possible to also implement untyped JavaScript code directly.\n untyped __js__ (\"window.alert ('Hello!')\");\n\n ...extern classes tend to help provide a nicer API, however:\n Browser.alert (\"Hello!\");\n\n\nprotected\n The private keyword in Haxe behaves similar to the protected keyword in ActionScript.\n\ntypeof\n ActionScript 3.0 uses the typeof keyword to return a generic String value for the current object:\n switch (typeof obj) {\n     case \"boolean\": trace (\"obj is a boolean\"); break;\n     case \"number\": trace (\"obj is a number\"); break;\n     default:\n }\n\n Haxe allows a similar check using Type.typeof, though it returns a static type (not a String).\n switch (Type.typeof (obj)) {\n     case TBool: trace (\"obj is a boolean\");\n     case TInt, TFloat: trace (\"obj is a number\");\n     default:\n }\n\n\nuse\n Haxe does not support custom namespaces like ActionScript 3.0.\n\nvoid\n Haxe uses Void instead of void (for better consistency with other type names).\n\nwith\n The ActionScript 3.0 with keyword is a shorthand approach that can reduce the amount of code that is written, but it has some limitations (such as not being able to declare new variables inside) which can make it unpredictable to use.\n var clip = new MovieClip ();\n with (clip) {\n     x = 100;\n     y = 100;\n }\n\n Haxe does not support the with keyword, it may make code more verbose, but it can make code simpler to understand and more reliable.\n var clip = new MovieClip ();\n clip.x = 100;\n clip.y = 100;\n\n\n\nHaxe also has additional keywords that are not defined in ActionScript:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncast\nenum\nextern\n\n\ninline\nnever\ntypedef\n\n\nuntyped\nusing\n\n\n\n"},"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/variables.html":{"url":"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/variables.html","title":"Variables","keywords":"","body":"Variables\nActionScript and Haxe both use the var keyword to define a new variable. This can store a reference to an object, or it can store a value, such as an integer or string.\nNaming Limitations\nA class level variable, or property, must have a unique name.\nclass Test {\n\n    public var hello:String;\n    public var hello:Int; // error, cannot reuse name\n\n    public function new () {\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIn ActionScript 3.0, you cannot use a name more than once in a local variable either, but in Haxe, you are allowed to redefine a local variable.\npublic function hello ():String {\n\n    var value = \"Hello\";\n    trace (value);\n\n    var value = 100; // not allowed in ActionScript\n    trace (value);\n\n}\n\nVariable names cannot be a reserved keyword, and cannot use special characters (except for \"_\"). ActionScript 3.0 allows use of the dollar sign (\"$\") character in variable names, but their use is not allowed in Haxe.\nNaming Conventions\nActionScript and Haxe commonly use \"camel case\" when naming variables. This means that the name starts in lowercase, but uses uppercase at the start of each new word (such as itemCount or applesAndBananas).\nBoth languages also commonly use an underscore (\"_\") at the beginning of a private variable name (such as _secretValue).\nIt is also recommended to try and use variable names that are descriptive. This can be difficult to do, but will always make it easier to understand code without additional comments. FORCE_OF_GRAVITY, for example, will probably be easier to understand than _g in most cases.\nIt is also common convention to use all capital letters for a constant value, such as SPEED_OF_LIGHT.\nAccess Control\nActionScript 3.0 supports four built-in levels of access for class properties:\n\npublic\n The variable will be accessible to other classes\n\nprivate\n The variable will be accessible only within the current class\n\nprotected\n The variable will be accessible within the current class, or by classes that extend the current class\n\ninternal\n The variable will be accessible within the current class, and other classes in the same package\n\n\nHaxe simplifies these controls to two levels of access. public behaves similarly to the ActionScript public level of access, and private behaves similarly to the Actionscript protected level of access.\nYou can use @:access, @:allow or @:privateAccess meta-data in Haxe to access or allow private access between classes, supporting other use cases.\nHaxe also adds support for controlling read and write access to a variable, using the following syntax:\npublic var hello (read, write):String;\n\nFor example,\npublic var hello (default, null):String;\n\nThe following kinds of read and write access are supported:\n\ndefault\n Access will perform as it would normally\n\nget\n Read access will use a getter function, named get_hello (or whatever the property name is), when reading the value\n\nset\n Write access will use a setter function, named set_hello (or whatever the property name is), when writing the value\n\nnull\n Read or write access will be allowed inside of the current class, or children of the current class, but will not be allowed externally\n\nnever\n Read or write access will never be allowed, even inside the current class\n\n\nGetters and Setters\nActionScript 3.0 allows support for simulating read-only variables, or variables with a custom setter, by using a get or a set function, and an additional private variable.\nprivate var _readOnly:String;\n\npublic get function readOnly ():String {\n\n    return _readOnly;\n\n}\n\nHaxe supports more powerful access control per-variable, so this is not required. However, both languages support get and set functions when more powerful control is required:\nActionScript 3.0\nprivate var _custom:String;\n\npublic get function custom ():String {\n\n    return _custom;\n\n}\n\npublic set function custom (value:String):void {\n\n    _custom = value;\n\n}\n\nHaxe\npublic var custom (get, set):String;\n\nprivate var _custom:String;\n\nprivate function get_custom ():String {\n\n    return _custom;\n\n}\n\nprivate function set_custom (value:String):String {\n\n    return _custom = value;\n\n}\n\nConstants\nConstants are properties that have a fixed value, and do not ever change.

This can be positive or negative\n\nuint\n An unsigned integer numeric value.

Int is most commonly used in Haxe projects, but UInt is available when desired.\nComplex Values\nAs a virtual machine, ActionScript defines a set of data types that store complex values. These include Object, Array, Date, Error, Function, RegExp, XML and XMLList.\nThe Haxe standard library includes similar data types, such as Dynamic, Array, Date, EReg and Xml. Most of the core data types are composed out of Haxe language features such as classes, enums, abstracts and externs.\nIn ActionScript 3.0, every value (whether primitive or complex) is an Object. In Haxe, the Dynamic type can be used to describe any type.\nIn ActionScript 3.0 and Haxe, you can define an array using array literal syntax, or by using an array constructor.\nvar list = [ 1, 2, 3 ];\nvar list2 = new Array ();\n\nThe ActionScript core Array type is dynamic. This means that the Array type will allow any kind of value in the same object:\nvar list:Array = [ 1, \"2\", false ];\n\nFor better performance, and more nuanced control over code, Haxe arrays are statically typed, which means that it accepts only values of one type by default, unless it is a dynamic array.\nvar mixed:Array = [ 1, \"2\", false ];\nvar integers:Array = [ 1, 2, 3];\n\nHaxe does not include a core Error type, but allows errors to be thrown of any type\nif (error) {\n\n    throw \"Something bad happened!\";\n\n}\n\n"},"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/operators.html":{"url":"comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/deep-dive/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nArithmetic Operators\nActionScript and Haxe both use the following operators, and behave similarly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n-\n*\n\n\n/\n%\n++\n\n\n--\n\n\n\nEquality and Comparison Operators\nActionScript and Haxe both use the following operators, and behave similarly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==\n!=\n\n\n\n>\n\n>=\n\n\n\nHowever, ActionScript has two additional operators which are not used in Haxe:\n\n===\n In ActionScript 3.0, an equality (==) comparison can sometimes make a conversion.

Especially if you are new to the Haxe programming language, it can be difficult to realize what is wrong.\nThis is a short list of compile errors you may encounter, and some explanations for what may be the underlying issue.\nClass not found: Object\nThe Object type in Haxe is called Dynamic. It is equivalent to the * type in ActionScript. It is also possible to remove some type declarations since Haxe supports type inference, like var foo = {};\nClass not found: Function\nThe Function type in Haxe can be described either by using Dynamic, or by using the signature of the method. For example, if the method accepts no parameters and returns a string, you could describe the function as Void -> String. If it accepted a boolean and a string, but had no return value, you could use Bool->String->Void as the type.\nIt is also possible to remove some type declarations since Haxe supports type inference, like var foo = function () {};\nClass not found: Number\nThe Number type in Haxe is called Float. It is also possible to remove some type declarations since Haxe supports type inference, like var foo = 0.0;\nClass not found: Boolean\nThe Boolean type in Haxe is called Bool. It is also possible to remove some type declarations since Haxe supports type inference, like var foo = false;\nClass not found: RegExp\nYou can try using the Haxe regular expression class, EReg\nInvalid number of type parameters for Array\nThe Array type in Haxe expects type parameters, to describe what the array contains. You can create a generic array using Array, or you can be more specific by using the appropriate types, like Array or Array>.\nIt is also possible to remove some type declarations since Haxe supports type inference, like var foo = [ 1, 2 ];\nMissing ;\nHaxe does not automatically close declarations based on new lines. For example, var foo = 1; needs to end with a semicolon, otherwise you will receive this error.\nThis can also be an indication that something else is wrong:\n\nYou may need to replace package { ... } with package;\nYou may need to fix a bad type on the line before, like uint\nYou may need to remove a bad keyword, like delete\nYou may need to change a value that uses a restricted Haxe keyword, like cast or callback\nYou may need to replace an as keyword with cast, cast () or Std.as()\n\nUnexpected }\nThere may be a logical error before this point in your code, or you have a mismatch in your curly braces. For example, if you change package { to package;, you may have forgotten to remove the closing brace lower in the file.\nUnexpected final\nUnlike ActionScript, Haxe does not have a final keyword. You can either remove the keyword or use @:final instead. If you use the @:final meta-tag, however, make sure that it appears before other keywords, like @:final public function, not public @:final function\nUnexpected foo (or other variable name)\nThis may be caused by a declaration which is not compatible with Haxe, like typeof foo, or you may need to convert a Flash getter or setter.\nIf a getter or setter is being used to limit access to a variable, like setting it to read-only, you can do this when defining a variable in Haxe, like var foo (default, null):String\nOtherwise, you can use the same syntax to use a getter or a setter, like var foo (get, set):String, then define your getter and setter methods later in the class (using the prefix \"get_\" or \"set\", respectively).\nUnexpected $foo (or other variable name)\nHaxe does not allow the dollar sign in variable or method names.\nUnexpected =\nThis might indicate that there is a bad type before the equal sign, like “uint”, or this may be caused by some kinds of compact syntax that are not compatible with Haxe.\nFor example, if the original code had foo ||= bar, you can replace it with if (foo == null) foo = bar;\nUnexpected public\nYou may need to replace public class with class\nType name should start with an uppercase letter\nBy convention, types like classes, interfaces, typedefs and enums begin with an uppercase letter.\nThis may also occur if you attempt to use a namespace, which is not supported in Haxe, or it may occur when referencing a global method that does not exist in Haxe. For example, getTimer should be Lib.getTimer, or methods like getDefinitionByName should be replaced with calls to the Type or Reflect classes.\nUnexpected /\nThis may occur when there is a regular expression that needs to be replaced.\nUnexpected var\nThis can occur if a for loop is not formatted for Haxe.\nIn other languages, a loop like for (var i:uint = 0; i  is fairly common. Written for Haxe, the same loop would be for (i in 0…100)\nSimilarly, a loop like for each (var i:String in myArray) in ActionScript would be for (i in myArray) when written for Haxe.\nUnexpected internal\nHaxe does not have an internal namespace. You should change it to private, then use the @:access, @:allow or (for a single-line call) @:privateAccess meta-data to access or allow private members.\nUnexpected ...\nHaxe does not support \"rest\" parameters like ActionScript 3.\nThere are ways to recreate the same functionality using Reflect.makeVarArgs, but it probably is best to refactor so that the number of parameters is known.\nUnexpected \nThis might occur if you are missing a closing curly bracket in your code.\nUnexpected dynamic\nIn ActionScript, the dynamic keyword means that a class can have new variables or methods assigned to it as a dynamic object. This is possible in Haxe by implementing Dynamic as an interface.\nFor example, dynamic class Foo implements Bar can be replaced with class Foo implements Bar implements Dynamic\nUnexpected implements\nThis probably means that a comma is missing.\nFor example, replace extends Foo implements Bar with extends Foo implements Bar\nUnexpected {\nThis might mean that you forgot a parenthesis in your code.\nUnexpected is\nYou can replace Foo is Bar with Std.is (Foo, Bar)\nUnexpected as\nThere is more than one way to perform casting in Haxe. In order to perform an unsafe (but fast) cast between types, you can use the cast keyword without parenthesis, like cast foo.\nIn order to perform a safe cast, use parenthesis, like cast (foo, Bar). This is similar to using Std.as in order to perform casting.\nYou can use Std.int, Std.parseFloat, Std.parseInt and Std.string in order to convert between basic types.\nUnexpected protected\nThe Haxe language does not have a protected keyword, but the private scope acts like protected in other languages.\nUnexpected *\nThis may mean that you need Dynamic in place of * for a type, or it may be caused by a wild card import, which will only apply to a single level.\nFor example, import flash.display.*; would work, but import flash.*; would not.\n"},"glossary/cheat-sheet.html":{"url":"glossary/cheat-sheet.html","title":"Cheat Sheet","keywords":"","body":"Cheat Sheet\nBasic Types\nActionScript 3\nBoolean\nint\nNumber\nObject\nvoid\nArray\nVector.\n\nHaxe\nBool\nInt\nFloat\nDynamic\nVoid\nArray\nArray\n\nPackage Declarations\nActionScript 3\npackage com.example.myapplication {\n\n}\n\nHaxe\npackage com.example.myapplication;\n\nDefining a Class\nActionScript 3\npublic class MyClass {\n\n   public function MyClass () {\n\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nHaxe\nclass MyClass {\n\n   public function new () {\n\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nLoops\nActionScript 3\nfor (var i:uint = 0;
